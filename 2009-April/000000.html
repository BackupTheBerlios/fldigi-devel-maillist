<PRE>I'm releasing a Panadapter package I've developed in collaboration with 
Jim N2ADR.
Here's the launch page (at the moment): 
<A HREF="http://wa5znu.org/2009/04/quisk-lppan-k3/">http://wa5znu.org/2009/04/quisk-lppan-k3/</A>

The base code is Jim's QUISK, a Python SDR program.  I've worked with 
Jim to make it more modular, and have separately released a module which 
interfaces with the Telepost LP-PAN product, the Elecraft K3, and fldigi.

The installation is fairly easy, but the configuration is all done by 
hand at this point, so there are some involved steps.  I hope to make 
the configuration easier in the future.

One of the features of the modules I've developed is that it can use the 
fldigi XML-RPC interface for rig control, so it can interoperate with 
fldigi.

Another module I've developed is a Python rigcontrol package, which 
controls the K3 directly.  For expediency, most of the operations are 
hard-coded; however, in the future I'd like to enhance it to use the XML 
application that Dave has developed for rigcat.  

My python packages are on pypi.sourceforge.net already; Jim's release of 
quisk 3.0 will be up shortly.

I realize none of you have this collection of hardware, however, because 
of the interaction with fldigi, I wanted to let you know.
Also, it's been occupying most of my ham programming time since February 
so I've had little time for fldigi.

With the move to the new git repo, I hope to make a clean start, and get 
back to adding some XML-RPC commands.
