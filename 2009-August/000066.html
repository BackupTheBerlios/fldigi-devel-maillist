<PRE>Hi,

Thank you for your excellent response.

Not that I want to argue the point, but no matter how many authors there
are, if they all agree to license the code in a non-GPL way, they are free
to do so. It's too bad, since we wanted to compensate the authors for their
excellent work.

We have considered the possibility that you suggest. We will probably go
ahead and make a &quot;headless&quot; decoding suite as you suggest. We call the
concept a &quot;decode server&quot;. What we envision is a stand-alone EXE that takes
standard PCM audio as an input, and acts as a server for sockets. A client
program will open a socket and send a request for a specific decode mode at
a specific audio freq. The server would then fork a thread to do the
decoding and service the socket.
The decoded text would be sent back over the socket for the client to do
whatever it wants. The request messages would be simple and defined in the
interface documentation.

I think that this approach would pass the aggregation test, since it would
be generally useful and the interface documented. We would have no problem
releasing it under GPL.

To do this, I think we only need the decoders and the underlying DSP
libraries. For our products we use the Intel Performance Primitives library,
which implements FFT, FIR, IIR &amp; many other functions in assembly language
using processor-specific floating vector instructions. It really screams,
but we may not be able to use it in this project because of GPL.

Once again, thanks for your comments and interest!

-Sam-

Subject: Re: Software License

Dave is of course correct that no individual can re-license the fldigi
modem code under GPL, as it's the combined work of many dozen people, all
released under GPL.

I can't answer for dave, and I've got my IANAL hat on now, but there's one
option I see by which SIGINT might be able to pursue using fldigi in their
otherwise proprietary product.  I know this because I've been involved
with similar issues before.

See
  <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation</A>

It might be possible to develop a GPL-released standalone decoding program
which accepts audio input and outputs decoding information via a network
TCP/IP. fldigi currently includes a few such capabilities using an
interface known as XML-RPC, but there is not a headless version, and I
don't believe it outputs all decoded text (though I may be wrong on the
last point).

If the headless version and the network TCP/IP interface were sufficiently
well-defined and generally useful, and not specific to SIGINT's products,
then it would likely pass the &quot;aggregation&quot; test.   The resulting changes
to fldigi would of course need to be released as GPL.

If you need to send audio data into fldigi to accomplish this, there's
likely already enough flexibility to do so using the PORTAUDIO and JACK
interfaces (the latter only on Linux, I'm afraid).

All this being said, while the headless &quot;build&quot; of fldigi with decoded
data output may be of general utility and interest (and it must be in
order to meet the &quot;mere aggregation&quot; test), it may not be a sufficiently
interesting project for any of the present developers to undertake.  A
paid developer (SIGINT, contractor) might be a good choice, but again, you
would face the possibility that the current development team might not
want to integrate the changes, particularly if they aren't well done or if
the effort would be a major distraction.

Leigh.
