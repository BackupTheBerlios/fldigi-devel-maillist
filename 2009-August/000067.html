<PRE>Sam,

You may want to take a look at DM780, which took a fork of the fldigi 
modem set, and PocketDigi, which copied the gMFSK modem set (which was 
one of the GPL sources of some of fldigi's modems). Both are of course 
GPL as well, but they are Windows-only packages and may be closer to 
your coding requirements.  Vojtech Bubnik does do DSP work commercially, 
so it may be that you can pay him to develop a headless, open-source 
version of PocketDigi.  As for DM780, I doubt that Simon Brown would be 
any more inclined to get involved with the actual development than I am, 
but of course you may want to contact him directly.  Those two packages 
may be closer to your goals, as DM780 has already been broken out into a 
library, and PocketDigi has a minimal UI designed for Windows Mobile.  
Again, I'm not suggesting that you simply use the DM780 DLL in your 
proprietary product, as that wouldn't be allowed under GPL.

The project you may be embarking on could potentially be useful, but in 
order to meet the letter and spirit of the &quot;aggregation&quot; clause, I do 
believe you must make a bona fide effort to make the package general and 
well-documented; the GPL cautions specifically against deep, internal 
interface data structures.

Good luck,
Leigh.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your excellent response.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not that I want to argue the point, but no matter how many authors there
</I>&gt;<i> are, if they all agree to license the code in a non-GPL way, they are free
</I>&gt;<i> to do so. It's too bad, since we wanted to compensate the authors for their
</I>&gt;<i> excellent work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have considered the possibility that you suggest. We will probably go
</I>&gt;<i> ahead and make a &quot;headless&quot; decoding suite as you suggest. We call the
</I>&gt;<i> concept a &quot;decode server&quot;. What we envision is a stand-alone EXE that takes
</I>&gt;<i> standard PCM audio as an input, and acts as a server for sockets. A client
</I>&gt;<i> program will open a socket and send a request for a specific decode mode at
</I>&gt;<i> a specific audio freq. The server would then fork a thread to do the
</I>&gt;<i> decoding and service the socket.
</I>&gt;<i> The decoded text would be sent back over the socket for the client to do
</I>&gt;<i> whatever it wants. The request messages would be simple and defined in the
</I>&gt;<i> interface documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this approach would pass the aggregation test, since it would
</I>&gt;<i> be generally useful and the interface documented. We would have no problem
</I>&gt;<i> releasing it under GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To do this, I think we only need the decoders and the underlying DSP
</I>&gt;<i> libraries. For our products we use the Intel Performance Primitives library,
</I>&gt;<i> which implements FFT, FIR, IIR &amp; many other functions in assembly language
</I>&gt;<i> using processor-specific floating vector instructions. It really screams,
</I>&gt;<i> but we may not be able to use it in this project because of GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, thanks for your comments and interest!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Sam-

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: Software License
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dave is of course correct that no individual can re-license the fldigi
</I>&gt;<i> modem code under GPL, as it's the combined work of many dozen people, all
</I>&gt;<i> released under GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't answer for dave, and I've got my IANAL hat on now, but there's one
</I>&gt;<i> option I see by which SIGINT might be able to pursue using fldigi in their
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise proprietary product.  I know this because I've been involved
</I>&gt;<i> with similar issues before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be possible to develop a GPL-released standalone decoding program
</I>&gt;<i> which accepts audio input and outputs decoding information via a network
</I>&gt;<i> TCP/IP. fldigi currently includes a few such capabilities using an
</I>&gt;<i> interface known as XML-RPC, but there is not a headless version, and I
</I>&gt;<i> don't believe it outputs all decoded text (though I may be wrong on the
</I>&gt;<i> last point).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the headless version and the network TCP/IP interface were sufficiently
</I>&gt;<i> well-defined and generally useful, and not specific to SIGINT's products,
</I>&gt;<i> then it would likely pass the &quot;aggregation&quot; test.   The resulting changes
</I>&gt;<i> to fldigi would of course need to be released as GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you need to send audio data into fldigi to accomplish this, there's
</I>&gt;<i> likely already enough flexibility to do so using the PORTAUDIO and JACK
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces (the latter only on Linux, I'm afraid).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All this being said, while the headless &quot;build&quot; of fldigi with decoded
</I>&gt;<i> data output may be of general utility and interest (and it must be in
</I>&gt;<i> order to meet the &quot;mere aggregation&quot; test), it may not be a sufficiently
</I>&gt;<i> interesting project for any of the present developers to undertake.  A
</I>&gt;<i> paid developer (SIGINT, contractor) might be a good choice, but again, you
</I>&gt;<i> would face the possibility that the current development team might not
</I>&gt;<i> want to integrate the changes, particularly if they aren't well done or if
</I>&gt;<i> the effort would be a major distraction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Leigh.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Understood Sam, but the current decoder/encoder source represents
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several years of GPL development with several different authors

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no need for additional income.  The appreciation of the fldigi user

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sufficient payment for my work.
