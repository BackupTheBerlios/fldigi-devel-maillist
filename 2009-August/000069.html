<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> On Mon, 17 Aug 2009 19:05:58 -0700, &quot;Sam Dunham&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-devel">Sam.Dunham at scanstar.com</A>&gt; said:
</I>
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your excellent response.
</I>
&gt;<i> Not that I want to argue the point, but no matter how many authors there
</I>&gt;<i> are, if they all agree to license the code in a non-GPL way, they are free
</I>&gt;<i> to do so. It's too bad, since we wanted to compensate the authors for their
</I>&gt;<i> excellent work.
</I>
&gt;<i> We have considered the possibility that you suggest. We will probably go
</I>&gt;<i> ahead and make a &quot;headless&quot; decoding suite as you suggest. We call the
</I>&gt;<i> concept a &quot;decode server&quot;. What we envision is a stand-alone EXE that takes
</I>&gt;<i> standard PCM audio as an input, and acts as a server for sockets. A client
</I>&gt;<i> program will open a socket and send a request for a specific decode mode at
</I>&gt;<i> a specific audio freq. The server would then fork a thread to do the
</I>&gt;<i> decoding and service the socket.
</I>&gt;<i> The decoded text would be sent back over the socket for the client to do
</I>&gt;<i> whatever it wants. The request messages would be simple and defined in the
</I>&gt;<i> interface documentation.
</I>
&gt;<i> I think that this approach would pass the aggregation test, since it would
</I>&gt;<i> be generally useful and the interface documented. We would have no problem
</I>&gt;<i> releasing it under GPL.
</I>
&gt;<i> To do this, I think we only need the decoders and the underlying DSP
</I>&gt;<i> libraries. For our products we use the Intel Performance Primitives library,
</I>&gt;<i> which implements FFT, FIR, IIR &amp; many other functions in assembly language
</I>&gt;<i> using processor-specific floating vector instructions. It really screams,
</I>&gt;<i> but we may not be able to use it in this project because of GPL.
</I>
I should point out that some work has already been done on &quot;headless&quot;
operation.  Probaby not lean enough for general-purpose embedding but
maybe useful for testing.

If you build fldigi with --enable-benchmark, the binary will recognise a
few additional switches that can be used for timing the modems' decoding
performance non-interactively and, incidentally, for batch decoding of
audio files.  Fldigi will not display any windows but will still require
a windowing system.  This is unfortunately difficult to rectify but easy
to work around with X11.

There is also the possibility of controlling a &quot;headless&quot; fldigi via
xmlrpc.  The decoder output (text only) is obtained by polling the
xmlrpc server, or (IIRC) by connecting to the ARQ port.

There are some examplesin the manual page.


Update:  I see that batch decoding with output to a text file is broken
in 3.12; fixed in git.


Best regards,
Stelios.
