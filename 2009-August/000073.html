<PRE>Hi Chris,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> On Wed, 19 Aug 2009 11:51:01 -0400, Christopher Moore &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-devel">christopher.h.moore at verizon.net</A>&gt; said:
</I>
&gt;<i> Hello Stelios,
</I>&gt;<i> I have had some success using fldigi-shell connecting to a headless 
</I>&gt;<i> fldigi running in a virtual frame buffer.  You probably haven't received 
</I>&gt;<i> many comments since most fldigi users will be happy with the standard 
</I>&gt;<i> windows-based UI.  
</I>
That is excellent news and I'm very pleased to hear that you have found
fldigi-shell useful.

&gt;<i> I am a blind operator and rely primarily on the text console to run 
</I>&gt;<i> applications.  I was thus favorable impressed to discover fldigi-shell.  
</I>&gt;<i> I've experiemented with it for only a few hours and only to receive 
</I>&gt;<i> bpsk31.  Here are some initial observations.  
</I>
&gt;<i> 1. The program starts in bpsk31 mode which was fine for my testing.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> assume you can change this using the modem.set_by_name command.  
</I>
Yes, the modem.set_by_name command will switch fldigi to any modem in
the list returned by modem.get_names.

&gt;<i> 2.  The modem.search_down and modem.search_up functions appeared to lock 
</I>&gt;<i> on to signals in the receive spectrum.  Using the poll function was 
</I>&gt;<i> quite helpful in determine whether the signal could be accurately 
</I>&gt;<i> decoded.  In addition, the modem.get_quality function provided another 
</I>&gt;<i> measure of the signal quality.  It would also be helpful to have a 
</I>&gt;<i> modem.get_imd function to be able to provide imd measurements for 
</I>&gt;<i> stations with distorted signals.
</I>
The main window has two status boxes that display modem-specific textual
signal information.  The contents of the text boxes are returned by the
commands main.get_status1 and main.get_status2.  For PSK, these are SNR
and IMD respectively.  They are only available when the other station is
transmitting an idle tone.

&gt;<i> 3. Next, I switched the modem to cw. and attempted to decode a cw 
</I>&gt;<i> signal.  This test was unsuccessful because I didn't have a way of 
</I>&gt;<i> locking the carrier frequency tonto the cw signal.  Whereas the 
</I>&gt;<i> search_up and search_down work for psk, I don't know what the 
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding functions would be for cw, rtty or some of the other 
</I>&gt;<i> modes.  Perhaps its just a matter of exposing existing methods within 
</I>&gt;<i> the current fldigi code.
</I>
The search_up and search_down functions are only implemented for PSK and
RTTY; in other modems they do nothing.  Perhaps some of the other modems
could get this feature too -- Dave will know :)

&gt;<i> 4.  When tuning in psk signals it would be handy to have an audible 
</I>&gt;<i> indication of the carrier frequency.  I had my receive audio on so I 
</I>&gt;<i> could hear the signals but I didn't know which signal was being decoded. 
</I>&gt;<i> Because I am not currently transmitting I used the main.tune function to 
</I>&gt;<i> generate a carrier through the soundcard to help me identify the current 
</I>&gt;<i> carrier frequency.  This approach is just a hack until I begin 
</I>&gt;<i> transmitting.  A better approach would be to generate a tone through the 
</I>&gt;<i> soundcard without activating the ptt or send it to a different soundcard 
</I>&gt;<i> or possibly to the pc speaker.
</I>
One generic way to implement something like this would be with an
fldigi-shell command that calls a user-defined defined program and
passes it the main operating parameters (e.g. modem, frequency).  Or
even an option to run that program automatically every time the
parameters change via the shell.  The external program would know what
to do with the information, e.g. use text to speech to a second
soundcard.  Would this work?

&gt;<i> 5.  fldigi config files: Aside from running fldigi under a standard X 
</I>&gt;<i> server and using the graphical UI to configure the program, are there 
</I>&gt;<i> any utilities to create an xml config file which could be edited by 
</I>&gt;<i> hand?  
</I>
The configuration file is named fldigi_def.xml and can be found under
the ~/.fldigi directory.  It is generated with default values when
fldigi is run for the first time.

Although many of the xml tag names are self-documenting, some options
have values that are impossible to guess without seeing the GUI or
reading the source code.  In particular, some modem parameters are
stored as the index of the menu item whose label describes the
parameter.  For example, the Olivia bandwidth might be stored as
&lt;OLIVIABW&gt;2&lt;/OLIVIABW&gt;, and this would be 500 Hz because &quot;500&quot; is the
third number in the menu (starting from zero)!

It would be difficult to fix this without breaking compatibility with
earlier versions...  However, I think the config writer could be
extended to include comment strings (which would be defined in
configuration.h along with the other bits).  The XML reader ought to be
able to ignore &lt;!-- comments --&gt;, I'm sure Leigh will know.

&gt;<i> 6.  What additional fldigi functionality could be exposed to the shell?  
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is quite a lot.  Clearly anything to do with clicking the mouse 
</I>&gt;<i> in the waterfall display would have no simple counterpart in a shell, 
</I>&gt;<i> but many of the other functions such as qrz call lookup, qso logging, 
</I>&gt;<i> selection of macros and the like should be quite doable.  
</I>
Yes, there is plenty more that could be made available as shell
commands.  I'd be more than happy to add new commands, maybe even
w1gm. ones :-)  Please let us know what would be useful.

&gt;<i> Again, you are to be congratulated for developing fldigi-shell as it 
</I>&gt;<i> provides another important way to access fldigi.  From my comments it 
</I>&gt;<i> should be clear that I welcome further development of fldigi and I would 
</I>&gt;<i> be interested either in testing or in assisting with some of the coding.
</I>
Thank you for your kind words, Chris.  A good way to stay up to date
with new test releases and development is to join the fldigi-alpha
mailing list at BerliOS:

  <A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-alpha">http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-alpha</A>

The page above also links to the other lists/groups.

And of course do let us know if you would like to join the project as a
developer.


PS.  I have copied <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-devel">fldigi-devel at lists.berlios.de</A> so that the other
developers can join the discussion.
