</I>Domino and Thor would be good candidates for an automated search.  MFSK 
and Olivia have too much latency in the decoding path to allow a search 
acquisition to work.  They also require very accurate tuning.  MT63, if 
used as intended, only transmits on increments of 500 Hz.  Signal 
acquisition only requires that the decoder be within +/- 100 Hz of the 
actual transmitted center frequency.  Throb might also be a candidate 
for a search algorithm.  Feld is a quasi FAX mode and very visual.  You 
would probably not benefit from trying to implement automatic search for 
any of the Feld modes.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because I am not currently transmitting I used the main.tune function to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soundcard without activating the ptt or send it to a different soundcard 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or possibly to the pc speaker.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>Are you tuning the psk signal by matching the TUNE carrier with the 
received signal Chris?  Would the

modem.get_carrier
modem.inc_carrier (by a plus or minus amount)

shell commands be useful to you?

How are you using the shell commands Chris?  Are you using Stelios' 
fldigi-shell perl script or have you developed your own interface?  If 
your own are you using a script language?
&gt;&gt;<i> 5.  fldigi config files: Aside from running fldigi under a standard X 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server and using the graphical UI to configure the program, are there 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any utilities to create an xml config file which could be edited by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hand?  
</I>&gt;<i> the config writer could be
</I>&gt;<i> extended to include comment strings (which would be defined in
</I>&gt;<i> configuration.h along with the other bits).  The XML reader ought to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to ignore &lt;!-- comments --&gt;, I'm sure Leigh will know.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I agree with Stelios on the possible modification to the xml definition 
file.
&gt;<i> And of course do let us know if you would like to join the project as a
</I>&gt;<i> developer.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I would like also extend an invitation to join the developer staff Chris.
