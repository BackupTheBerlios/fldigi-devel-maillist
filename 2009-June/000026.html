<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> On Mon, 29 Jun 2009 08:23:51 -0400, Ed &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-devel">autek2 at gmail.com</A>&gt; said:

&gt;<i> 1. Is there a way to grab the information from an external application,
</I>&gt;<i> such as a DXcluster ?  In other words if I select DXCC entity and Not
</I>&gt;<i> worked before, if a DX spot for an entity not in my log is spotted on
</I>&gt;<i> the cluster, can that trigger the alert ?
</I>
There is currently no way to receive this information from external
applications, only decoded signals.

To implement this, I would probably add a new XML-RPC call that external
programs can use to send callsigns to fldigi.  Fldigi would then pretend
that it heard the callsign on the air and notify the user, but of course
_not_ send anything to psk reporter or any other external services.

On the other hand, an external program that listens to the DX cluster
could also do the rest of the work by accessing the adif logbook and
cty.dat (etc.) files.  And then fldigi could limit itself to filtering
duplicates and send the &quot;spots&quot; to that program for processing and
notification.  Even better if that program did its own dup filtering,
then we'd just feed it callsigns as they came in.

The other way of course is for fldigi to do everything itself.  I
personally know very little about DX clusters and likely won't have
time to write any kind of cluster access code for fldigi in the near
future, even if we decide that it's a good idea and not &quot;feature creep&quot;
:<i>-)
</I>

I think we need an generic aggregator/notifier suited to hamradio
(hamgregator? :) that can do at least the following:

1) Interface with fldigi (and maybe also other programs) to receive
   callsigns.  Also other sources like DX clusters.

2) Access the user's logbook, either directly or via some kind of
   RPC.  Also the cty.dat, lotw, eqsl databases.

3) Notify the user when something interesting happens.

It might also be capable of doing other things with the information.
For example, send it to a DX cluster (if it didn't originate from that
type of source), or PSK reporter, or twitter, or... see bad ASCII art
below.

And of course it should be free software and run on POSIX systems!

If we wrote a helper program like that to distribute with fldigi, it
would probably have to be written in FLTK and C++, given that on some
systems (ahem) there are usually no scripting languages installed.  But
a separate program could easily require a perl or python runtime, or
even be a web service.
