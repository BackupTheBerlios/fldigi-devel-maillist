<PRE>I've got a snapshot of the FCC ULS database loaded into a Google App 
Engine database and have a small Python script serving it up.    
Attached is a hacky patch to 3.13AZ which uses it if you have specified 
online QRZ.  There is no authorization required, so the main change is 
to take out the auth request, mostly in order to reduce net traffic to 
the GAE hosted site.

Apply this diff in fldigi-3.13AZ/src/misc and recompile  It should work. 

Note there is no geocode data, and that as it is ULS, it is FCC only.

Problems Encountered:
I had to massage the data with a GPL bash / MySQL script to join the 
license class and &quot;Active&quot; flags to the callsigns, and then becasue I 
couldn't figure it out in bash, I used Emacs to remove non-ASCII 
characters (nonbreaking space, the &quot;1/2&quot; character, and for good 
measure, all accented chars and one &quot;ae&quot; diglyph).

It's difficult to delete data from a GAE hosted site.  I would up giving 
up on the site I created and making a second one, hence the &quot;ulsham2&quot; name.

Next steps:
. automate the process of getting and applying weekly/daily FCC updates
. look into geocoding

I think the best possible outcome would be if other free providers of 
ULS service adopt the same interface and then I don't need to keep this 
site.
