<PRE>Last week I upgraded my Ubuntu 9.04 jaunty to 9.10 karmic, what a mess. When
I tried to run fldigi none of the required library files (*.so) were found
as shown by running the ldd command against fldigi, and some other
programmes. These programmes had worked on the 9.04. Yes, they were all
there in the right place. 

 

So yesterday I reinstalled from clean and everything worked again
eventually. I had problems in that the clean install broke my grub
multi-boot environment, but that was easily fixed. I then decided just for
the fun of it to compile both fldigi and flrig.

 

No problems with fldigi, the instructions on the web site were excellent and
all of the necessary libraries were found with synaptic. Compiled and ran
perfectly.

 

Not quite so easy for flrig as the library requirements are not stated.
After a number of makes I determined that the libraries needed are:-

               libxft-dev

               libxinerama-dev

               libcurlocaml-dev

 

I hope I got those names spelt right.

 

After compiling and no more errors, there is however one little problem with
flrig, [version 0.9.956] the left mouse button does not increase the
frequency but the right one lowers it. (the mouse buttons work correctly in
fldigi).

 

Before I go plunging into the code, has anyone seen this behaviour before in
Ubuntu? Note, I have not tried the precompiled version yet to see if that
mimics this behaviour, I somehow do not expect it to.

 

n.b. this is the first time I have compiled and done anything like this in
about a decade so it was all a new experience. So the instructions were very
good as far as I was concerned, and I am not a programmer but a naval
architect.

 

Thanks,
