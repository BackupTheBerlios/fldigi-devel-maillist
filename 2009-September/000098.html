Hello Dave,
 
we've never met or communicated with one another before, my name is Gus 
Kegelaers ON6KE, I'm 55, since 1974 in ham radio, 95% of it cw until I 4 
weeks ago decided that I wanted to explore the digital modes for the 
first time. I started looking around for communications freeware, my 
'quest' to come up with applications like DigiPan, SMARTPSK, Airlink 
Express and some others too until I last week Thursday stumbled on
Fldigi.
 
What I want is that I'm absolutely flabbergasted with quality, the 
appeal and the completeness of the product you guys produced for the ham 
community. I have no other words for it than that it is awesome!
 
I *love*:
- the logbook and the simple way in which you can feed it with data;     
[I loved the merge option too, I merged my 'old' logbook into Fldigi's, 
that was done in 30 secs time!]
- the total control one has over almost the entire 
app;                          [from colours over fonts, card settings, 
what have you]
- the incredible appeal of the app, the GUI's are waaw;
- the cheer *number of modes* that are all in one [1] 
product;              [yours!]
- the help function which is very neatly documented;
- the PSK browser with his up to 30 signals he can simultaneously decode;
- the sheer multitude of 
extra's;                                                         [I 
really like Notifications, the changing of frequencies in the waterfall 
if you dare tuning the transceiver, etc.]
- the macro functions, some of which I haven't seen anywhere else;     
 [there lies my *only* remark, you can tab text but you can't align text 
vertically]  
 
There's plenty more to get excited about like the logbook showing the 
data from a previous QSO with the same call, the adjusting the frequency 
in the waterfall if you want in 1 Hz steps, I just printed the manual, 
I'm dead certain there's even more in there I don't even know of yet!
 
All I want to say is that I from the bottom of my heart want to *thank 
you guys* for producing such a *fantastic product!*
 
Thank you.
Talk later.

Mechelen, Belgium.
