<PRE>Hi,

I hope Stelios won't mind if I unearth a message a year old
about I/Q. Some french fellow did ask me again for such
support, and I have some interest in too, but I'm still
somewhat busy with brick-and-mortar work ongoing in my home.

BTW, I've recently received congratulation from a french-only speaking
ham who is fond of the simplicity yet powerfulness of fldigi,
depicting the other pieces of software as gas factories :-)
Here it is shared with you, because the joy of the others
makes also your joy :-)

</I>[...]
&gt;<i> &gt; * I/Q input/output: thanks to SDR, more and more devices offer I/Q
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   signals. I, for myself, own a SDR1K and an Elektor SDR-USB.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   For fldigi, that would mean turning the soundcard to stereo,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   and dealing with complex signals from that point on. Feasible?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Configuration items would certainly be added to select 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the kind of audio input and output (mono, I/Q, reverse I/Q, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   The Dream DRM project (GPL'd) has a similar approach:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	0: left channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	1: right channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	2: mix both channels (default)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	3: I/Q input positive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	4: I/Q input negative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	5: I/Q input positive (0 Hz IF)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	6: I/Q input negative (0 Hz IF)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We used to have stereo input until we found out that one of the popular
</I>&gt;<i> USB soundcard/radio interface gizmos only has a single capture channel
</I>&gt;<i> -- I think it was a SignaLink.  Before then, the right audio channel was
</I>&gt;<i> simply discarded as there was is nothing in fldigi that can use it.
</I>
Then a new configuration choice must be proposed and it should 
be the default:

    	0b:mono (default)

&gt;<i> Playback is still stereo, but for modem data we only use the left
</I>&gt;<i> channel.  The exceptions are RTTY with the pseudo-FSK option, and CW
</I>&gt;<i> with the QSK option.  In these two cases we also generate a separate
</I>&gt;<i> signal on the right channel.
</I>
This is quite good, for complex signals, we can make use of
SoundBase::Write_stereo().

&gt;<i> Fldigi can work with SDR, and in fact I have used it with a Softrock
</I>&gt;<i> RXTXv6.1 kit that I built some time ago.  The I/Q signals were
</I>&gt;<i> demodulated by sdr-core (dttsp), which was managed by a frontend like
</I>&gt;<i> java-sdr.  Fldigi received the demodulated audio from dttsp via JACK.
</I>
IMHO, we can do away with the sdr-core. Not to say that sdr-core has no
game to play with fldigi (it is fact quite impressive), but its setup
is too complicated for no added value when you just want to do digi modes.

FYI, I've just integrated Si570 AVR-USB support in Hamlib...

&gt;<i> It would be feasible to add stereo back, but I don't think we have
</I>&gt;<i> anything in fldigi that can receive or generate quadrature signals.
</I>&gt;<i> How do you envision using the 2-channel audio?
</I>
The Dream DRM[1] is quite interesting. This GPL project has sample code[2]
which does complex-&gt;real signals on input and real-&gt;complex on output. 
Code of interest is in CReceiveData::ProcessDataInternal() (~line 240),
in the &quot;switch(eInChanSelection)&quot;. The transmit side is in 
CTransmitData::ProcessDataInternal(), begining of the file.

Back to fldigi, I was thinking about doing the conversion in
src/trx/trx.cxx: trx_trx_receive_loop() upon the call to scard-&gt;Read()
and in src/trx/modem.cxx: modem::ModulateXmtr() on the output way.
Wrapping the conversion in a class might be a good idea.

Now, while I can whip up a patch for the conversion, I'm missing 
the stereo input, unless that was the purpose of this mysterious
commit ecf1f101a2011695e642a105897e451ec893b47c, back in july...
