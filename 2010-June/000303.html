<PRE>I have some progress:

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) In order to use the CW-filters of my RIG I need to modify the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modes-menu (the FT980 has a single knob controling modes and filters)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>You will need to modify either the hamlib.cxx or rigio.cxx (and the 
</I>&gt;<i>FT980 xml file)
</I>
In fact I reactivated the PBwidth control which I found to be prepared
in the code but look strangely abandoned to me.

&gt;&gt;<i>You will need to modify either the hamlib.cxx or rigio.cxx (and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>FT980 xml file)
</I>
Are these xml-files also relevant to HAMLIB or only RIGCAT?

&gt;<i>Do you want to use machine generated CW?  You might want to consider 
</I>&gt;<i>interfacing fldigi to the cw demon that is available for linux.
</I>&gt;<i>Unless 
</I>&gt;<i>you are running a real time linux kernal you will find that is 
</I>&gt;<i>impossible to create accurate timing for the QSK keying.  That is the 
</I>&gt;<i>reason that fldigi uses the J2A approach to CW. 
</I>
I still do not quite understand the problem:
On the scope the envelope of right-channel audio and left-channel audio
look pretty much the same. When I activate QSK, right channel audio
sticks to 1kHz, while left channel audio changes according to the
RX-setting.
So to me the only difference between A1A and J2A should be in the
transformation audio-envelope-&gt;keying. This is purley a hardware issue
of my interface and the xcvr. What do I miss?

&gt;&gt;<i> BTW: It seems fldigi cannot use HAMLIB to control PTT via RTS.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As a workaround I have fldigi control RTS directly, but it would be
</I>more
&gt;&gt;<i> logical to entirly control the hardware via HAMLIB. Is there a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamental reason for this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>You will need to take a look at the hamlib backend for the FT980.  PTT 
</I>&gt;<i>via RTS does work with either hamlib or rigcat so long as it is not 
</I>&gt;<i>prohibited by the transceiver backend code.
</I>
Stephane (F8CFE) seems to expect the problem to be solved on the
fldigi-side (quote from the HAMLIB-developer mailing-list):
  In fact, fldigi needs some fixing because the case where a hamlib
  backend has RIG_PTT_SERIAL_RTS is not handled properly. Until
  the fix is made available, you can set ptt_type to RIG_PTT_NONE,
  and use the RTS PTT in fldigi as a temporary workaround.

Can you point me to a HAMLIB-backend with PTT-RTS control, that is none
to cooperate with fldigi? I will have a closer look at the issue than.

Thanks 

Wolfgang (DK1BW)
