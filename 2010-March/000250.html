<PRE>In response to a user request I'm looking into K2.xml on fldigi 3.20.0b3.

Here's some oddities I've found:

1. fldigi goes into a tight loop
It appears that somehow the K2.xml file sets retries and timeouts to 0, 
even though there are non-zero values in the file.
My guess is that these the 100% is related to the 0.
Perhaps there's a misspelling or format change and this file missed an 
update.

2. fldigi hangs
Once the file is corrected, fldigi still fails with log errors, but I 
can't copy them out because it goes into a 0% CPU hang.
I will look for a log file.

3. baud rate wrong
The baud rate is wrong.  I can't find a K2.xml on my system that has the 
baud rate 38400 in it so I don't know how it got there, but it's 
possible I made the mistake in mail.  It should be changed to 4800, 
regardless of any other issues raised in this message.

4. fldigi talks to k2 but doesn't understand it
If I get past the above issues (occasionally) I see in the debug-level 
logging for the rig control that it's sending queries to the rig and 
getting responses, but it claims it cannot parse them.  Once I get to 
where I can capture the data (and decode the hex) I will investigate 
this issue.
