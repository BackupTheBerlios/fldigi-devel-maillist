<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I used fldigi to operate in the ARRL CW sweepstakes and here are some 
notes in the form of bugs and feature/enhancement requests.

1. BUG: When all fields and contest fields are enabled AZ doesn't show.
I have rotor control macros which pass in $FLDIGI_AZ and if it's not 
display I don't know if my rotor control macros will work.
I had to switch out of fldigi or toggle the contest fields see.
When the menu says show all fields, it ought to show them all.
So I request that AZ show when Show All is set and Contest Fields is 
checked.

2. FER: &lt;clearlog&gt; macro
I'd like to clear the log after &lt;log&gt; without setting that optionally 
globally in config.  I'd like &lt;clearlog&gt; macro so I can do &lt;log&gt;&lt;clearlog&gt;.

3. BUG: intermittent right mouse copy-to-log behavior #1
I've had consistent problems with right mouse selection over the years 
and I suspect it's because there's something about it at odds with fltk 
and the workaround keeps getting broken.  So perhaps I should retrain 
myself.  But the symptom is that I right mouse on a callsign and select 
CALL and it fails to copy.  The heuristic click-and-auto-insert for call 
never fails.

4. BUG: intermittent right mouse copy-to-log behavior #2
Another intermittent failure is the same with highlighted region: I 
left-drag to highlight the RX exchange and get a red highlight.  Right 
mouse on Exchange then does nothing.  If I do the right mouse Exchange 
again, the highlighting turns pink and it works.  I don't know what the 
operation model is here but I'm not understanding it, or it's not 
consistent.

5. FER: two lines of macro buttons
I'd like to be able to select two lines of macros, for example:

ANS  / EXCHANGE /  Log QSO / CQ       NR! / PRC! / CK! / SEC!       
CALL! / AGN! / Stepper / ROTOR
                                       NR? / PRC? / CK? / SEC?       
CALL? / AGN? / QSL

In this example, line 1 is used mostly for hunt and pounce (NR! re-sends 
my serial number, for example).  Line 2 is used for asking for fills 
myself and responding QSL when done.

I took a look at it but the static fltk layout would have to change to 
allow this so it's not easily done as an option or a startup option.
I doubt most people want two lines of macros for normal operation, but 
for this SS contest with its many-part exchange, it would have been useful.
Perhaps there are other needs for more visible macros as well, at least 
temporarily.

6. Bug or FER: Spaces in macros
The &lt;exec&gt; call seems to insert a space in the TX buffer after use.  
Perhaps it's &lt;exec&gt;'s fault, but I'd still like a way to clear the TX 
buffer in macros.
We have RX clear but not TX clear. That way ANS, EXCHANGE, etc, would 
start with TX Clear.  The spaces introduce delays after you press one of 
the macros and that can disturb contest timing.

7. Bug: View Logbook
If I have just entered a log entry and do View Logbook it shows at the 
bottom.
Other times if I do View Logbook it show the most recent entry at the top.
It seems the sort order of View Log sometimes reverses.

7. Bug: Logbook out of order in logbook.adif
A QSO which started at 2359 and ended at 0001 showed up in the logbook 
in the wrong spot.  It was qso #71, and appeared between #19 and #20.
There was a gap between #70 and #72 where the W4RM qso belonged.  The 
QSO started on 20101107 2359 and ended at 20101108 000.   It improperly 
sorted as if it had started at 20101107 0001.
