Comment (by klotz):

 George,

 We've all been working together for many years.

 Olivia was written in C/C++ by Pawel Jalocha SP9VRC.  After Andy K3UK
 brought the mode to my attention, I got Pawel to release the source code
 under GPL; (he previously had wanted to control its use until he felt it
 was ready).  I worked with Tomi Manninen OH2BNS to incorporate the code
 into gMFSK.  I provided the sample audio clips of Olivia to the ARRL for
 use in their presentation on the mode and public documentation to assure
 its legality in the US.

 When Dave W1HKJ began the fldigi project, he used many of the gMFSK modems
 as part of his code base.  Simon HB9DRV took the modems from fldigi, and
 made DM780 available under GPL as well.  Patrick FC6TE has written
 MultiPSK in Pascal, and so is unable to use Pawel, Dave, or Simon's code
 or their changes directly, and so his implementation is coded wholly by
 him.  (Patrick also often makes changes in algorithm, for example using
 frequency-domain comb filters instead of time-domain bandpass filters for
 tone detection.)

 I don't know how the MixW folks do their work, but I suspect their
 codebase is in C and C++ and they started from Pawel's original code, but
 presumably either re-wrote it wholly or received it from Pawel under a
 different license, since MixW's source code is not available under GPL.

 If you're observing problems decoding, it would be great it if you could
 use the audio capture capability of fldigi to record something that it
 cannot decode to a WAV file, and then decode it in MixW or DM780, and then
 provide the WAV file along with the decode settings you used in the
 various programs.

 If you can't attach it here, then please send it to me (WA5ZNU) or join
 the fldigi mailing lists and send it there.
