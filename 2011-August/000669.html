<PRE>I have received several requests from MARS officials to add the 
MIL-STD-188 modes to fldigi.  The documents which describe these modes 
can be found here:

<A HREF="http://www.w1hkj.com/developers/">http://www.w1hkj.com/developers/</A>

Daniel provides some background on the reason for the request in his 
email below.  At this time the only software modem program which 
supports any of the 188 modes is MultiPsk.  Patrick's code is written in 
a Pascal derivative.  He might be willing to share his code base with 
the fldigi developers, but my past experience with his code is that it 
is very difficult to transpose to C++.  I am sure that this is partly 
due to his code being written using a mix of English and French as the 
naming convention for variables, functions etc.  And most certainly due 
to my not coding in Pascal for over 30 years.

Would you be interested in working with me on creating the MIL-STD-188 
PSK-75 modem class for fldigi?  Please give serious consideration to 
assisting on this worthwhile endeavor.

Dave, W1HKJ

Hello Dave.

Have you made any progress or further research on the subject of adding some
basic/key MIL-STD modes to FLDigi?  Of all the waveforms defined in
MIL-STD-188-110B (or -110A), MARS only needs the waveforms for PSK 75, 150,
300, 600 baud speeds at this point.  Currently MARS is making the transition
to using MIL-STD-188-110B modes on all MARS nets over the next six months or
so.  Ham digital modes, such as Olivia, MT63, and others will be phased out
of Army MARS completely---at least that's the plan from HQ Army MARS.
Pactor should be remaining as a tool for MARS (especially for WL2K), at
least as long as it takes to have equivalent error-free ARQ MIL-STD mode
readily available to MARS members.  It will be a tough task to find another
MIL-STD mode good enough to ever leave WL2K. However, the peer-to-peer modes
are transitioning to the MIL-STD modes right away.

What is immediately needed are some, but not all, of the waveforms in
MIL-STD-188-110B, specifically the waveforms for PSK 75, 150, 300, 600 baud.
The higher speed waveforms (1200, 2400, 4800, etc.) are not necessary at
this time.

Regarding terminology, as it turns out, STANAG-4415 is the same as the
MIL-STD-188-110B waveform at 75 baud.  So, implementing the MIL-STD-188-110B
waveforms for PSK 75, 150, 300, 600 baud will automatically include
STANAG-4415.   The details for MIL-STD-188-110B waveforms for PSK 75, 150,
300, 600 begin in paragraph 5.3 of MIL-STD-188-110B.  Just as a note for
clarification, MIL-STD-188-110B supersedes MIL-STD-188-110A but you?ll see
some references to -110A in other documentation.  Essentially, the waveforms
that are defined in -110A are included in -110B.  MIL-STD-188-110B is
expanded, however, to include other waveforms.

Also, if there are programming or time limitations that you must deal with
then the PSK speed of 75 baud should be the first MIL-STD-188-110B waveform
implemented.  This is because the PSK 75 baud is the NATO standard (also
known as STANAG-4415) and would give immediate interoperability.  And of
course, please let me know if you now have enough information to implement
MIL-STD-188-110B waveforms for PSK 75, 150, 300, 600.

Whew????.I think that?s all.  Let me know if you need any more questions
answered.  We really want to see FLDigi with the capability of the MIL-STD
modes above.  MultiPSK now has the -110A mode available but many of us
prefer the user interface, the GUI, of FLDigi.

We sure could use your support to make this happen.  The sound card based
choices are &quot;slim pickings.&quot;

Thank you for your email request and specification documents Daniel.

I will look at the  specification for the two modes and consider them
for inclusion in fldigi.
