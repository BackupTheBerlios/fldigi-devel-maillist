In Debian Sid oss4-dkms is broken, so I've had to install from the
upstream source. It works fine, sound quality is notably better than
ALSA (music).

The only _big_ problem with oss is suspend/resume. It really dies on
suspend, so it needs a soundoff/soundon on resume, but you need to
restart every program using the sound system. This is *very* obnoxious.

I think the noise in the wf is much less with oss. I've made a couple of
tries back and forth with ALSA last night in 40m BPSK and I think fldigi
could decode far down in the noise using oss.
It's really my impression, it's very difficult to test this because that
would need two computers with the same hardware (I tried fldigi in a 
virtual box but with poor results) feed from the same receiver, which I
have not. But I _really_ think that oss is a very big improve over ALSA.

Anyone else share this opinion?
