<PRE>First of all apologies this was sent to the wrong fldigi mailing list, and thanks for the replies. In answer to some of the suggestions received so far,
I don't think the file seek operation is the source of the problem - looking at strace the named pipe is closed when i deselect my &quot;stream&quot; checkbox,
so there shouldn't be any file seek. After some more tests with strace I've found that I get +++ killed by SIGFPE +++ at the end of the log, after the 
named pipe has been closed, but only if fldigi is not started  from the command line. I've attatched the strace log recoded when starting fldigi from 
outside the command line, starting playback without delays from the SDR hardware, then unchecking the &quot;Stream&quot; checkbox, causing fldigi to quit.   

&lt;copy of my previous email follows below&gt;

 I am working on a project to add support for a cheap software defined radio based on a chipcon cc1020 to fldigi. There are details of the project here

The existing playback in vanilla fldigi uses a delay function that inevitably delays for slightly longer than necessary, this created a problem for my application,
as data would back up in the named pipe used to pass the resampled data to fldigi in wav format. I have attempted to add support for a new &quot;stream&quot; function
that eliminates all delays. Unfortunately this has resulted in a weird bug that I have been unable to fix; when the stream checkbox is unselected the UI stays
responsive, but it appears the backend processing in fldigi hangs, as the waterfall display stops scrolling and cannot be restarted.
 This only occurs when using named pipes, if i attempt to open a .wav file with the new stream checkbox, there are no apparent problems - it is possible to
 start and stop playback at any point (although the data is processed extremely quickly using 100% cpu - as would be expected as the reads never block).
It is however possible to use the SDR without issue (apart from the obvious buildup of data in the pipe) using playback. So to sum up, this bug only appears
when unchecking the new stream checkbox after having used it to playback from a named pipe. It should also be borne in mind that the named pipe is
immediately closed for writing as soon as my resampling program receives SIGPIPE - indicating that fldigi has closed the pipe for reading. I have attempted
to use strace to debug, and it appears that the UI along with file open and close is still working after the waterfall hangs - i can reboot my SDR hardware and
 attempt to reconnect to the named pipe with fldigi and the file open appears in the strace log, but the waterfall never restarts and no data comes out of the
 modem. At no point is fldigi using excessive cpu either.
 I am not a c++ developer, and am not familiar with the fldigi source, so I though someone here might be able to offer their assistance.
 Thankyou for your time
