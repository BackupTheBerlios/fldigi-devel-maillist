</I>All of the microHAM products are first class.  I think that Josef is 
ignoring a large (and growing) part of the ham community by not 
providing Linux / OS X support.  He can do that and still remain 
proprietary.  That is what many of the video card manufacturer's do.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe there is a conflict between GPL and protecting
</I>&gt;<i> microHAM's IP.  Chen's code is fully public but he does not
</I>&gt;<i> release the microHAM documentation and your team could certainly do 
</I>&gt;<i> the same.
</I>There is a very fundamental difference between uRouter and the fl--- 
line of applications.  These have all been licensed under either the GPL 
or the LGPL, both of which require complete disclosure of all code that 
is used in the application.  fldigi has a parentage that reaches back 
through several generations of code, all of which were GPL.  Chen has 
basically published his uRouter and other applications with NO LICENSE.  
He is therefore free to disclose as much or as little as he chooses.  
Another developer can use as much or as little of his code as they want, 
but they assume full responsibility for any disclosure (inadvertent or 
otherwise) of proprietary or copyrighted material.

Please keep the fldigi developers in mind should Josef ever decide to 
open up the specifications.

73, Dave
W1HKJ
