Dave,

I have heard from Jozef regarding documentation for you and he
does not require an NDA.  However, he has one condition before
I forward you the internal protocol document.

&gt;<i> I have no problem if final source code is public, from source code is
</I>&gt;<i> very hard if not impossible to make different, software compatible
</I>&gt;<i> product. Of course if protocol document isn't 1:1 copied in the
</I>&gt;<i> source files :-)
</I>
In other words, you are free to make the source public under the terms
of GPL but the protocol document (or even substantial parts of it) may
not be included in the source or released to others beyond the limited
number of persons with a direct need to know.

&gt;<i> All of the microHAM products are first class. I think that Josef is
</I>&gt;<i> ignoring a large (and growing) part of the ham community by not
</I>&gt;<i> providing Linux / OS X support.
</I>
OS-X seems to be covered adequately by Chen, Don Agro (MacLogger DX),
and Tom Lindner (DL2RUM).  Jozef has always believed that LINUX support
would be nice but he has been burned by the LINUX developer community on 
several previous occasions when promises of support have turned into
dead silence.

microHAM's programming resources are already stretched to the limit
in supporting the existing/planned hardware development and Windows user 
base.  From Jozef's perspective, LINUX is a very small minority market 
that does not justify the expense of adding another full-time
programmer to the development staff for what most estimates consider
to be at best 15% of the amateur market.

PS. USB Interface III should work in the LINUX environment without
     any special support software.  Both the sound card and USB to
     serial converter are standard hardware (no embedded processor
     to support) with manufacturer supplied drivers.  I have used
     it in both OS-X and Windows without Chen's uH Router or the
     microHAM Router package.

</I>&gt;<i> All of the microHAM products are first class. I think that Josef is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't believe there is a conflict between GPL and protecting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> microHAM's IP. Chen's code is fully public but he does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release the microHAM documentation and your team could certainly do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same.
</I>&gt;<i> There is a very fundamental difference between uRouter and the fl---
</I>&gt;<i> line of applications. These have all been licensed under either the GPL
</I>&gt;<i> or the LGPL, both of which require complete disclosure of all code that

</I>&gt;<i> through several generations of code, all of which were GPL. Chen has
</I>&gt;<i> basically published his uRouter and other applications with NO LICENSE.
</I>&gt;<i> He is therefore free to disclose as much or as little as he chooses.
</I>&gt;<i> Another developer can use as much or as little of his code as they want,
</I>&gt;<i> but they assume full responsibility for any disclosure (inadvertent or
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise) of proprietary or copyrighted material.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please keep the fldigi developers in mind should Josef ever decide to
</I>&gt;<i> open up the specifications.
