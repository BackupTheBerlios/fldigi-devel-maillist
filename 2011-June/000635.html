<PRE>    I just purchased a 13 inch MacBook Pro.  For the most part it is a 
sweet machine and runs the precompiled NBEMS binaries very well.  But I've 
run into an odd problem.

    Coming from the Linux world, I love virtual desktops.  So I enabled 
spaces in OS X, which is the Mac equivalent.

    Here's the problem I'm running into and it is repeatable:

    1) Operate PSK-31 in Fldigi in Space 1 and select a station in the 
waterfall.
    2) Swith to Space 2 and read a webpage in Firefox.  In my machine, I 
can switch between spaces with ctrl-right arrow.
    3) Switch back to Space 1 with crtrl-left arrow.

    Now try to select another station in the waterfall.  You can't, no 
matter how many times you click on another position in the waterfall, the 
red cursor will just not move.  This happens until go into the receive 
pane in Fldigi and select Clear.  At this point I can now select another 
station in the waterfall, and I can keep selecting different stations 
until I switch spaces again.

    What in the name of Steve Jobs is going on?  Is this an obscure bug in 
Fldigi, or am I stepping in an OS X bug/feature?

    There's one issue I've been able to work around.  The 13 inch MacBook 
Pro has no dedicated analog line in.  Fortunately, a good friend of mine 
loaned me a device made by Griffin named an iMic that works very well. 
It is essentially a USB soundcard with line/mic and headphone jacks. 
Unlike other similar USB audio devices, this has a switch to allow one to 
change impedence between mic and line.  I find the audio from the mic 
position is too &quot;hot&quot;, but the &quot;line&quot; psosition works just fine.
