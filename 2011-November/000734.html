<PRE>before too many people get the wrong impression, i think it best we
all educate ourselves about the new 60m privileges we will be gaining
and make sure we don't promote misinformation.

the new rules will be effective 30 days after 16-Nov-2011.  it is not
true that all digital transmissions will be
required to be at the center frequency only.  digimode users will need
only tune their VFO as recommended
and stay within the allocated channel bandwidth.  the new power limit
will be 100W into a dipole rather than 50W as before.  power output
must be reduced for those using an antenna with more gain than a
dipole, as before.

one channel is to be DELETED and one channel ADDED to the list of
permissible transmission allocations.

what is true is -CW- operators will be required to use the center
frequency ONLY.  RTTY users must center their transmission in the
channel as well.

one question in my mind:  digimodes like psk31 can coexist in close
proximity to CW transmissions.  does this mean we may &quot;tuck ourselves
in&quot; surrounding a CW transmission in a channel (on a non-interference
basis, of course) ?
