I agree we'll need to see what the &quot;best practices&quot; document from the 
ARRL says, as the FCC has officially tasked them with writing it up.  
And I think we should do what we can to help FCC-licensed ham users of 
fldigi comply.

However, I am not sure I understand how you come to the following 
conclusion, based on the R&amp;O:

&gt;<i> it is not true that all digital transmissions will be required to be 
</I>&gt;<i> at the center frequency only. digimode users will need only tune their 
</I>&gt;<i> VFO as recommended and stay within the allocated channel bandwidth. 
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> what is true is -CW- operators will be required to use the center 
</I>&gt;<i> frequency ONLY. RTTY users must center their transmission in the 
</I>&gt;<i> channel as well.
</I>
Although I will defer to the official ARRL interpretation, it seems 
fairly plain to me in the R&amp;O that we are limited to operating on 
channel centers in digital modes:
<A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/document/amateur-radio-service-5-mhz">http://www.fcc.gov/document/amateur-radio-service-5-mhz</A>

    33. /Operation on Channel Centers/. Section 97.303(h) currently
    requires that amateur operators
    ensure that their station's transmission occupies only 2.8 kHz
    centered at each of the five center
    frequencies.  The /NPRM /proposed that, for amateur stations
    transmitting CW emissions and PSK31 data
    emissions, the carrier frequency shall be set to the center
    frequency.  NTIA has requested that we continue
    to restrict amateur service transmissions in this manner.59
    34. Ten commenters (ARRL, Currier, Downs, Hambrecht, Mabry, McVey,
    Richmond, Schaaf,
    Thomas, Watkins) oppose our proposal because it would impose an
    inefficient limitation on the use of the
    frequency bands that make up the designated channels.60 ARRL states
    that it is possible to have multiple
    CW and/or PSK31 communications ongoing simultaneously within the 2.8
    kHz channel, so long as those
    simultaneous communications are not limited to the channel
    centers.61 Two commenters (Hambrecht,
    Richmond) recommend that multiple emissions be permitted, if the
    emissions outside the allotted channel
    are suppressed.62
    35. By contrast, NTIA opposes the authorization of multiple
    emissions within a 2.8 kHz channel
    and claims that such an action would significantly increase the
    likelihood of harmful interference to
    important Federal operations and that difficulty in identifying
    interfering amateur stations could
    significantly inhibit rapid use of these channels by primary Federal
    stations for such uses as emergency
    communications.63 NTIA observes that all five of the channels
    allocated for secondary amateur service use
    are also authorized for use by primary Federal stations, and states
    that the five channels were provided to
    the amateur community in order to meet requirements for disaster
    communications, and that use of
    additional frequencies would not enhance interoperability with
    Federal stations.
    36. We adopt the center frequency requirement as proposed in the
    /NPRM/.  Because the amateur
    service operates in the 60 meter band on a secondary basis, we pay
    particular attention to NTIA's position
    and the interests of Federal agencies that have primary status in
    the band.  We conclude that continuing to
    restrict amateur stations to transmitting on the center frequencies
    will maintain the limited number of
    amateur operators using the five channels at any given time and
    provide certainty as to where such
    operations can be found.  By not upsetting the expectations of the
    Federal users of the band, we are
    confident that they will be able to immediately reclaim these
    frequencies from secondary amateur radio
    operations, if and when necessary.  Accordingly, we amend Section
    97.303(h) to specify that control
    operators of stations transmitting phone, data, and RTTY emissions
    (emission designators 2K80J3E,
    2K80J2D, and 60H0J2B, respectively) may set the carrier frequency
    1.5 kHz below the center frequency,
    and that, for stations transmitting CW emissions (emission
    designator 150HA1A), the carrier frequency is
    set to the center frequency.64
