<PRE>from the same FCC document:
&quot;Accordingly, we authorize control operators to transmit the following
additional emission types and designators in the 60 meter band: CW
emissions, limited to emission 150HA1A (i.e., Morse code telegraphy);
data
emissions, limited to emission 2K80J3E (exemplified by PACTOR-III);
and RTTY emissions, limited to
emission 60H0J2D (exemplified by PSK31).&quot;

notwithstanding the apparent typographical errors in the designators
used in quote above:

note that they are regulated based on emission designator, not any
particular digital &quot;mode&quot;.  also within the document is the
acknowledgement that 2K80J2D and 60H0J2B emissions are generated by a
single-sideband transmitter whose -carrier- frequency is set 1.5kHz
below the target center frequency in USB mode with audio being fed
into the transmitter.

the R&amp;O refers only to the carrier frequency of the transmitter and
the emission designation.

by the same R&amp;O, i am not obligated to use any particular audio
frequency except those that keep my emissions within the channel's
designated 2.8kHz bandwidth because the R&amp;O states my emission must be
within the designated bandwidth and my carrier frequency must be set a
certain way but does not prescribe an audio frequency.

it is just as plain to me when the FCC refers to a carrier frequency,
they mean the VFO frequency and they say nothing at all about which
audio frequency i use to modulate the transmitter to create the
emission.

i certainly hope the ARRL will include John Johnston W3BE in the
drafting of the guidelines you mention, since he has a unique and
clear way of explaining his understanding of the rules and regs.

&gt;<i> Although I will defer to the official ARRL interpretation, it seems fairly plain to me in the R&amp;O that we are limited to operating on channel centers in digital modes:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/document/amateur-radio-service-5-mhz">http://www.fcc.gov/document/amateur-radio-service-5-mhz</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 33.&#160;Operation on Channel Centers.&#160;Section 97.303(h) currently requires that amateur operators
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that their station's transmission occupies only 2.8 kHz centered at each of the five center
</I>&gt;<i> frequencies. &#160;The&#160;NPRM&#160;proposed&#160;that, for amateur stations transmitting CW emissions and PSK31 data
</I>&gt;<i> emissions, the carrier frequency shall be set to the center frequency. &#160;NTIA has requested that we continue
</I>&gt;<i> to restrict amateur service transmissions in this manner.59
</I>&gt;<i> 34.&#160;Ten commenters (ARRL,&#160;Currier, Downs, Hambrecht, Mabry, McVey, Richmond, Schaaf,
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas, Watkins) oppose our proposal because it would impose an inefficient limitation on the use of the
</I>&gt;<i> frequency bands that make up the designated channels.60&#160;ARRL states that it is possible to have multiple
</I>&gt;<i> CW and/or PSK31 communications ongoing simultaneously within the 2.8 kHz channel, so long as those
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneous communications are not limited to the channel centers.61&#160;Two commenters (Hambrecht,
</I>&gt;<i> Richmond) recommend that multiple emissions be permitted, if the emissions outside the allotted channel
</I>&gt;<i> are suppressed.62
</I>&gt;<i> 35.&#160;By contrast, NTIA opposes the authorization of multiple emissions within a 2.8 kHz channel
</I>&gt;<i> and claims that such an action would significantly increase the likelihood of harmful interference to
</I>&gt;<i> important Federal operations and that difficulty in identifying interfering amateur stations could
</I>&gt;<i> significantly inhibit rapid use of these channels by primary Federal stations for such uses as emergency
</I>&gt;<i> communications.63&#160;NTIA observes that all five of the channels allocated for secondary amateur service use
</I>&gt;<i> are also authorized for use by primary Federal stations, and states that the five channels were provided to
</I>&gt;<i> the amateur community in order to meet requirements for disaster communications, and that use of
</I>&gt;<i> additional frequencies would not enhance interoperability with Federal stations.
</I>&gt;<i> 36.&#160;We adopt the center frequency requirement as proposed in the&#160;NPRM. &#160;Because the amateur
</I>&gt;<i> service operates in the 60 meter band on a secondary basis, we pay particular attention to NTIA&#8217;s position
</I>&gt;<i> and the interests of Federal agencies that have primary status in the band. &#160;We conclude that continuing to
</I>&gt;<i> restrict amateur stations to transmitting on the center frequencies will maintain the limited number of
</I>&gt;<i> amateur operators using the five channels at any given time and provide certainty as to where such
</I>&gt;<i> operations can be found. &#160;By not upsetting the expectations of the Federal users of the band, we are
</I>&gt;<i> confident that they will be able to immediately reclaim these frequencies from secondary amateur radio
</I>&gt;<i> operations, if and when necessary. &#160;Accordingly, we amend Section 97.303(h) to specify that&#160;control
</I>&gt;<i> operators of stations transmitting phone, data, and RTTY emissions (emission designators&#160;2K80J3E,
</I>&gt;<i> 2K80J2D, and 60H0J2B, respectively)&#160;may set the carrier frequency 1.5&#160;kHz below the center frequency,
</I>&gt;<i> and that, for&#160;stations transmitting&#160;CW emissions (emission designator 150HA1A), the carrier frequency is
</I>&gt;<i> set to the center frequency.64
