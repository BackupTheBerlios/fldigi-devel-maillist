<PRE>I think you're right about typos and ambiguity; for example, this seems 
to me to say that they don't want two PSK QSOs going on at the same time 
within earshot:

  &quot;We conclude that continuing to
restrict amateur stations to transmitting on the center frequencies will maintain the limited number of
amateur operators using the five channels at any given time and provide certainty as to where such
operations can be found.&quot;


I'm all for clarity, and in the end, it doesn't matter what you or I 
think on this matter.
So I'm willing to give it a rest until we find out more.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> note that they are regulated based on emission designator, not any
</I>&gt;<i> particular digital &quot;mode&quot;.  also within the document is the
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledgement that 2K80J2D and 60H0J2B emissions are generated by a
</I>&gt;<i> single-sideband transmitter whose -carrier- frequency is set 1.5kHz
</I>&gt;<i> below the target center frequency in USB mode with audio being fed
</I>&gt;<i> into the transmitter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the R&amp;O refers only to the carrier frequency of the transmitter and
</I>&gt;<i> the emission designation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> by the same R&amp;O, i am not obligated to use any particular audio
</I>&gt;<i> frequency except those that keep my emissions within the channel's
</I>&gt;<i> designated 2.8kHz bandwidth because the R&amp;O states my emission must be
</I>&gt;<i> within the designated bandwidth and my carrier frequency must be set a
</I>&gt;<i> certain way but does not prescribe an audio frequency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it is just as plain to me when the FCC refers to a carrier frequency,
</I>&gt;<i> they mean the VFO frequency and they say nothing at all about which

</I>&gt;<i> emission.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i certainly hope the ARRL will include John Johnston W3BE in the
</I>&gt;<i> drafting of the guidelines you mention, since he has a unique and
</I>&gt;<i> clear way of explaining his understanding of the rules and regs.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although I will defer to the official ARRL interpretation, it seems fairly plain to me in the R&amp;O that we are limited to operating on channel centers in digital modes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/document/amateur-radio-service-5-mhz">http://www.fcc.gov/document/amateur-radio-service-5-mhz</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 33. Operation on Channel Centers. Section 97.303(h) currently requires that amateur operators
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ensure that their station's transmission occupies only 2.8 kHz centered at each of the five center
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequencies.  The NPRM proposed that, for amateur stations transmitting CW emissions and PSK31 data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emissions, the carrier frequency shall be set to the center frequency.  NTIA has requested that we continue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to restrict amateur service transmissions in this manner.59
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 34. Ten commenters (ARRL, Currier, Downs, Hambrecht, Mabry, McVey, Richmond, Schaaf,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thomas, Watkins) oppose our proposal because it would impose an inefficient limitation on the use of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequency bands that make up the designated channels.60 ARRL states that it is possible to have multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CW and/or PSK31 communications ongoing simultaneously within the 2.8 kHz channel, so long as those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simultaneous communications are not limited to the channel centers.61 Two commenters (Hambrecht,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Richmond) recommend that multiple emissions be permitted, if the emissions outside the allotted channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are suppressed.62
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 35. By contrast, NTIA opposes the authorization of multiple emissions within a 2.8 kHz channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and claims that such an action would significantly increase the likelihood of harmful interference to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important Federal operations and that difficulty in identifying interfering amateur stations could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significantly inhibit rapid use of these channels by primary Federal stations for such uses as emergency
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communications.63 NTIA observes that all five of the channels allocated for secondary amateur service use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are also authorized for use by primary Federal stations, and states that the five channels were provided to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the amateur community in order to meet requirements for disaster communications, and that use of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional frequencies would not enhance interoperability with Federal stations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 36. We adopt the center frequency requirement as proposed in the NPRM.  Because the amateur
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> service operates in the 60 meter band on a secondary basis, we pay particular attention to NTIA&#8217;s position
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the interests of Federal agencies that have primary status in the band.  We conclude that continuing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restrict amateur stations to transmitting on the center frequencies will maintain the limited number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amateur operators using the five channels at any given time and provide certainty as to where such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operations can be found.  By not upsetting the expectations of the Federal users of the band, we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confident that they will be able to immediately reclaim these frequencies from secondary amateur radio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operations, if and when necessary.  Accordingly, we amend Section 97.303(h) to specify that control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operators of stations transmitting phone, data, and RTTY emissions (emission designators 2K80J3E,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2K80J2D, and 60H0J2B, respectively) may set the carrier frequency 1.5 kHz below the center frequency,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and that, for stations transmitting CW emissions (emission designator 150HA1A), the carrier frequency is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set to the center frequency.64
