<PRE>Brian,

Dave Baxter, (G8KBV) &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-devel">dave at g8kbv.demon.co.uk</A>&gt;, has provided very recent 
updates to the TS870S.  These are not in the flrig public release code, 
but are in the current alpha version which is close to being released.  
Please look at the code

http:://www.w1hkj.com/alpha/flrig/

and base any changes you make on that source tree.  I would recommend 
that you coordinate your changes with G8KBV.

Good luck on the code changes and ask for help if you need any.  See 
comments within your original email below.

73, Dave, W1HKJ

</I>&gt;<i> I would like to start looking at the flrig code to get it working on OS X 64 Lion with my TS-870S. I may also want to add rig for my PCR1000 if I can find the energy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been looking at the code and my first thought is to add some more instrumentation to better debug the traffic between flrig and the rig. I would like to extend the current debug object and send the output to the status_log.txt file. My thoughts were to:

</I>I'm not sure what benefit that would provide
&gt;<i> 2) Modify the --debug parameter to include --debug=N were N is a number indicating the level of debug.
</I>Very simple to add to the command line parameters.  The flrig debug code 
is based on the same code (simplified) that is in fldigi.  It is a 
simplified model since there are fewer threads in flrig.
&gt;<i> 3) Adding the instrumentation.
</I>Dave, G0WBX, may have already added some of the commands / queries that 
you want to work on.
&gt;<i> Does this sound like a good approach? Is there something in the fldigi code that would be better and make this more consistent across the suite? I have only looked at the flrig code in detail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this makes sense, is there any particular functions I should instrument based on the experiences of the group?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently disabled so I probably will not get this done too fast, but I have been doing C++ for 25 years so I have a little experience.
</I>It sounds like you would be an asset to the development team.  We would 
welcome your contribution.

Dave
