<PRE>Is anyone else interested in QRSS RX?

QRSS is a collection of modes designed for QRPP weak-signal work where the
RX is done by visual inspection of waterfall records.  The vast majority
of QRSS work is done in the &lt;100mW range.

TX is usually 5Hz FSK CW with a 6-second dit time, though there are faster
and slower variants.  There are also a number of other modulation schemes
in use, including Hellschreiber and a direct picture-like mode (like the
Visual Mode ID) in fldigi, sending both text and simple graphics such as
sawtooth and delta/nabla marks, followed by a faster CW id.

While most of it is done on the ham bands, there are some people using it
on the ISM bands such as 13 MHz and the various MF and LF allocations.  On
the ham bands, QRSS TX is usually done with a &quot;MEPT&quot; (manned experimental
propagation transmitter) instead of a beacon, due to regulations designed
to prevent spectrum misuse and interference.  QRSS MEPT transmitters use
little power or bandwidth, but are generally only on when they can be
monitored by the TX licensee.

The bands are narrow: on 30m the activity is in a 100Hz band centered on
10.140 KHz.  The centers of activity are similarly narrow on other bands.

The most popular RX program for QRSS is Argo.  Argo receives in a
horizontal waterfall and has a very slow waterfall rate left-to-right
across the screen, so that CW and writing may be read left-to-right after
each 10-minute screenful.  Argo saves screenshots to a directory, where
they can be uploaded to a server.  For samples, see here:
<A HREF="http://digilander.libero.it/i2ndt/grabber/grabber-compendium-North_America.htm">http://digilander.libero.it/i2ndt/grabber/grabber-compendium-North_America.htm</A>

I have two patches locally applied to fldigi to let me use it for QRSS RX,
and some points of departure for the rest:

1. waterfall height
I patched the dialog to allow waterfall height up to 600px.
You don't need actually to do this; you can edit fldigi_def.xml directly.
Since the point of QRSS is to display 5-10 minutes of waterfall, this is
critical.

2. Waterfall Speed
I added two new waterfall speeds beyond SLOW: QRSS3 and QRSS6.
I have them in sequence only when mode==CW, just for my own sanity. If we
had a QRSS mode then it would be conditioned on that mode.
I didn't benchmark against ARGO to see the actual lengths, just doubled
SLOW and doubled it again.  I believe (But am not sure) that the idea is
for QRSS3 would display 5 minutes and QRSS6 would display 10 minutes of
samples.
This is critical as well, for the same reason as #1.

3. waterfall direction
No patch, but manual: I save the waterfall screen area and rotate it left
90, then flip it vertically so that higher frequencies are at the top and
time starts on the left.   Attempting to re-work the display code so that
it could work in both the current and the QRSS-friendly orientation seems
like a lot of work for not much benefit.  So, see #4 below.

4. waterfall save
It would be nice to have an XMLRPC command to fetch the waterfall image or
to save it to a file and return the filename; then a simple script could
do the rotations.

4. FFT bins
Since the signal bandwidth is 5Hz and the whole band is only 50 Hz wide,
using smaller FFT bins helps. Argo uses very narrow bins; 328 mHz, in some
examples I've seen.  Fidigi uses, I believe (someone correct me?) giving
750 mHz bins, at 4x waterfall scale and then does decimation-in-frequency
to display  2x and 1x.  It would be nice to offer smaller bins and a
longer integration time for this very weak-signal work, but I haven't
attempted it yet.

Please take a look at a couple of the sample screen grabs here to get an
idea of what I'm talking about above.
