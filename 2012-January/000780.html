<PRE>I have installed and run flrig-1.2.6 and fldigi-3.22.0BM on both OS X Lion and Windows 7 Home Premium 64B running under Fusion 4.1.

Both were installed on the same Mac mini with Windows7 running in a virtual machine.  The radio is the Ten Tec 599 Eagle using its built in USB interface.  No hardware changes, cable moves or anything else physical is required to go from the OS X to the Windows 7 versions of the software.

The test results were the same with one exception.  The exception is that when flrig quits on OS X it changes the receiver BW to 100 Hz and ten releases the front panel BW control for normal use.  The Windows version correctly releases the BW control to the front panel knob but reaves the actual BW set to wherever is was when quitting flrig.   I believe that this is NOT A NEW issue.

I did notice that I had to reset my receive and transmit fonts and it APPEARS that the screen images are much sharper and clearer when running under OS X.   It was not that apparent in the Windows 7 version but that may well be the result of running in the virtual machine.

The tests were 100% from my perspective Dave.

</I>&gt;<i> The maintainers are aware, and perhaps others as well, that the underlying user interface for the applications, FLTK (Fast Light Tool Kit) has dropped support for the FLTK-1.1 branch.  Future support will only be for the 1.3.x branch.  Future Linux distributions will not provide repository support for FLTK-1.1.  It was therefore necessary to port all of the applications to the FLTK-1.3.0 library.  A simple upgrade right?  Wrong!!  The 1.3.0 version of FLTK now supports UTF-8 character encoding.  That alone touches nearly every widget in the UI set.  Worse, the changes made in the library code is different for Linux, Windows and OS X.  I think that the flxxx application base is now good to go.
