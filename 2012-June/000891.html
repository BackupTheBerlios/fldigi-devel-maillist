<PRE>&quot;I proposed KISS to Phil Karn back in about 1987&quot;

Did not do anything in the mean time ???

</I>&gt;<i>     Ahoy Remi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Strictly speaking, I was asking for more digital modes operating
</I>&gt;<i>     under the Ax25 protocol - that allows several stations to share a
</I>&gt;<i>     single frequency slot simultaneously, as Packet does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That requires some kind of media access control protocol (MAC). All KISS
</I>&gt;<i> provides is an intelligent interface between an external device (modem,
</I>&gt;<i> PAD) and the computer via a standard serial port. It is just a lot
</I>&gt;<i> easier to interface to a device using the KISS protocol than something
</I>&gt;<i> else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But KISS itself is just a very simple interface protocol and does not
</I>&gt;<i> really do anything to 'help' the actual transmission protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I proposed KISS to Phil Karn back in about 1987 as a way to move the
</I>&gt;<i> entire protocol stack into the PC and stop using the not-very-good AX.25
</I>&gt;<i> code that was common in the TNCs of the day. PCs had serial ports but
</I>&gt;<i> the actual USART and modem were in the TNC. KISS was a way to &quot;dumb
</I>&gt;<i> down&quot; the TNC to where it became much more useful for experimentation.
</I>&gt;<i> We just needed a way to assemble the SDLC frames for transmission and
</I>&gt;<i> get the SDLC frames received by the TNC into the computer without any
</I>&gt;<i> additional processing. That made our TCP/IP experimentation much easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I know that PSK modes for example can be utilized this way, as
</I>&gt;<i>     Q15x25 is a psk mode, and also due to an Ax25 version of PSK31 that
</I>&gt;<i>     I heard about a few years ago - but never found a copy to evaluate.
</I>&gt;<i>     - Maybe they were talking about an early version of  FLARQ, I dunno.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As with FLARQ, Ax25's ARQ connected mode QSOs can be done with a
</I>&gt;<i>     variety of digital modes. - I would guess that anything capable of
</I>&gt;<i>     being used with FLARQ - could also be utilized with Ax25 protocol or
</I>&gt;<i>     AMP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Short of amateur multicast protocol ( AMP ) nothing else approaches
</I>&gt;<i>     the spectal efficiency possible with the Ax25 protocol, and spectral
</I>&gt;<i>     efficiency is of particular interest, here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AX.25 is not particularly efficient at anything. The bell 202 modem is
</I>&gt;<i> suboptimal for anything serious over-the-air. AX.25's lack of adaptive
</I>&gt;<i> timers makes it tend to collapse if there is any attempt to run two or
</I>&gt;<i> more sessions over the same channel concurrently with each session
</I>&gt;<i> offering traffic levels that saturate the channel. Also CSMA only works
</I>&gt;<i> if all the stations can hear all the other stations, not something that
</I>&gt;<i> happens on HF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you are serious, you really need to roll something new. I believe
</I>&gt;<i> that CSMA/CA using slot reservation shows a lot of promise. As for the
</I>&gt;<i> modem/waveform, I think that IFK is ideal, especially when running over
</I>&gt;<i> NVIS channels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, ARQ on a per-packet basis is pretty inefficient. We have the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to buffer huge amounts of data. No reason not to send large
</I>&gt;<i> blocks of data and then later request retransmission of only damaged
</I>&gt;<i> frames, i.e. selective reject as opposed to go-back-n.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AX.25 was an interesting experiment in the 1980s. We learned a lot from
</I>&gt;<i> it, mostly all the ways that it is broken. :-) Time for something new.
