<PRE>Remi:

I use the virtual KISS interface in MixW ( MultiPSK also does this ) so that 
I may use MixW's modems with Packet software that requires a KISS interface. 
Using virtual COM ports, no hardware is required other than what the 
soundcard interface for MixW requires to talk to the radio.

Dave Kleber:

Here is the AX25 specification:   <A HREF="http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html">http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html</A>

It's just a protocol, and so requires no special hardware. AX25 is a special 
communications protocol developed for amateurs way back when, as Packet 
Radio was developed.

This intro to Packet Radio by Larry Kenny, WB9LOZ is much better than any 
explanation that I could offer here, or anywhere else. It explains about 
basic Packet. <A HREF="http://www.choisser.com/packet/">http://www.choisser.com/packet/</A>

Advanced Packet intro: 
<A HREF="http://uspacket.org/network/index.php/topic,15.0.html">http://uspacket.org/network/index.php/topic,15.0.html</A>

In general: cruise around the LIBRARY section at USPacket.Org for more info: 
<A HREF="http://uspacket.org/network/index.php?action=forum#2">http://uspacket.org/network/index.php?action=forum#2</A>

Many learned and learned-sounding gentlemen ( usually amateur tcpip fans ) 
will go on at great length about how awful ax25 is, how it couldn't possibly 
work on HF, and how easy it would be to better it - but I have heard this 
little story hundreds of times over dozens of years - and guess what? - Not 
a single one of these learned-sounding gentlemens have managed to cough up 
anything that does the same thing at all, much less do it any better... - 
All hat and no cattle, as we say here in Texas.

Meanwhile, the &quot;impossible&quot; 300 baud HF Packet network that started a 
quarter of a century ago is still a going concern today.

Amazing, isn't it?

I would like to see more AX25'ed digital modes besides 300 baud Packet, some 
slower and some faster, and some better at cutting through the crud. - I'd 
like to have a virtual KISS interface ( software-only KISS, no hardware TNC 
required ) so that the newly available AX25 digital modes can be used by 
amateurs with a wide variety of popular Packet Radio software, already 
well-developed and ready to go.

Brian Lloyd:

What you say about Packet is all true - about twenty-five years ago... Where 
have you been, OM?

( Hint ) A lot has gone on, addressing your list of insurmountable 
problems. - Have you tried talking about these issues with people who know 
something about Packet Radio, most particularly its development over the 
last few decades?

Remi will tell you about it, you are sadly underinformed, OM. - But I can 
tell that you are a gentleman.

The library section at USPacket.Org has a lot of good info about advanced 
Packet, but it is derivative of what I have learned from European websites 
about Packet.

Back in the early 90's, when TAPR picked up its holy mission to destroy evil 
AX25 Packet so that a &quot;critical Mass&quot; could develop for amateur TCPIP that 
never came about - because US TCPIP guys were a lot better at tearing things 
down than they ever were at producing anything - the European hams went 
right on developing the evil AX25 instead.

Nothing that the US amateur tcpip folks ever accomplished on a small scale 
could begin to compare with what the Europeans accomplished with the evil 
AX25 - on a continental scale. - I am taliing 'orders of magnitude' here. - 
A big difference.

The primary advantage that the Europeans had was - No TAPR.

We could have done just as well, maybe better in some way but we'll never 
know now. - We've had TAPR.

So do not lecture me about AX25 Brian, parroting tired, stale and wrong 
arguements that I have been hearing verbatim for decades because that's how 
long its been since the folks who came up with them have had anything to do 
with Packet. - Thereby apparently missing out on a couple of decades of 
development.

Please, informed arguments if you don't mind.
