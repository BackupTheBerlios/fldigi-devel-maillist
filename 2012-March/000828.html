<PRE>I have just sat through 8 hours of tornadoes moving either North or 
South of me.  Several communities within 3 miles were devastated.  We 
were without power for most of the day and was just able to get back on 
line a few minutes ago.  You can probably tell by my response that I was 
less than happy to read W0WHW's rant on the NBEMSham yahoo group.  To 
tell you the truth I think it might be time for a change.

I propose the following:

Ownership of the NBEMSham group be transferred to either of you or 
someone you think would have an interest.  I would continue to own and 
manage the linuxham yahoo group.

Publishing of NBEMS related software specifically for EMCOMM be done 
separate from my www.w1hkj.com web site.  You would need to have the 
ability to test on various Windows, Linux and OS X computers to insure 
the viability of the published software.

Identify and enlist new programmer resources for various elements of the 
NBEMS suite.  You may need to find professional (read $) help in this 
regard.  I'm sure that William has pockets as deep as his opinions.  I 
would discontinue any work on flwrap, and flmsg.

Possibly rename most of the applications so as not to confuse them with 
the apps which were or will be published on my web site.

That would free me to continue development of fldigi and flrig as my 
principal areas of interest.  The NBEMS developers could pick and choose 
from both as updates to these two applications continue to evolve.

73, Dave, W1HKJ
