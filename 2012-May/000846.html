<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for the quick response. I am working off the git source for
remotes/flrig/master; does this have Dave's latest code? I am comfortable
working in git, but can work off the source distros if that makes it
easier.

I am probably just being anal in wanting to add the mutex to debug, I've
spent too many late night hours trying to solve parallel process issues so
I tend to get over conservative, even in simple cases where the code works
fine with the current threading model and even when it fails all that
should happen is some mangled debug output. I once spent two days debugging
a problem that did not exist because of a synchronization issue in the log
file output.

I have been really impressed by the code so far, some of the easiest open
source code to work in I've looked at. I love the way flrig is laid out,
makes it real easy to do things.

Cheers,
Brian

 Brian,

Dave Baxter, (G8KBV) &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-devel">dave at g8kbv.demon.co.uk</A>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-devel">dave at g8kbv.demon.co.uk</A>&gt;, has
provided very recent updates to the TS870S.  These are not in the flrig
public release code, but are in the current alpha version which is close to
being released.  Please look at the code

http:://www.w1hkj.com/alpha/flrig/

and base any changes you make on that source tree.  I would recommend that
you coordinate your changes with G8KBV.

Good luck on the code changes and ask for help if you need any.  See
comments within your original email below.

73, Dave, W1HKJ

Hi all,

I would like to start looking at the flrig code to get it working on
OS X 64 Lion with my TS-870S. I may also want to add rig for my
PCR1000 if I can find the energy.

I have been looking at the code and my first thought is to add some
more instrumentation to better debug the traffic between flrig and the
rig. I would like to extend the current debug object and send the
output to the status_log.txt file. My thoughts were to:

1) Replace the current variable based synchronization with a pthread mutex.

 I'm not sure what benefit that would provide

2) Modify the --debug parameter to include --debug=N were N is a
number indicating the level of debug.

 Very simple to add to the command line parameters.  The flrig debug code
is based on the same code (simplified) that is in fldigi.  It is a
simplified model since there are fewer threads in flrig.

3) Adding the instrumentation.

 Dave, G0WBX, may have already added some of the commands / queries that
you want to work on.

Does this sound like a good approach? Is there something in the fldigi
code that would be better and make this more consistent across the
suite? I have only looked at the flrig code in detail.

If this makes sense, is there any particular functions I should
instrument based on the experiences of the group?

I am currently disabled so I probably will not get this done too fast,
but I have been doing C++ for 25 years so I have a little experience.

 It sounds like you would be an asset to the development team.  We would
welcome your contribution.

Dave

Cheers,
Brian
