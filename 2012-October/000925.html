<PRE>Andrej:  I've combined all of your UTF-8 work into a single commit.  
Also changed the location of the character set selector to the 
Colors-Fonts dialog and added an entry in the configuration.h file.

All:  You can also download a tarball of this work

       * New high speed and multi carrier modems
         - psk, pskr
         - DominoEX
         - Thor
       * Added separate modem initialization for
         Olivia tone / bandwidth pairs:
         - 4/250, 8/250
         - 4/500, 8/500, 16/500
         - 8/1000, 16/1000, 32/1000
         - 64/2000
       * RSID changes
         - Changed RsID detector prefilter to Blackman
         - Increased extended RsID detection timeout to 1 sec
       * MFSK UTF-8 tx
         - corrected transmit of two-byte UTF-8 characters
       * PSK-UTF-8 tx
         - corrected transmit of two-byte UTF-8 characters

     Thumbdrive

       * discover application executable location
       * if the directory in which &quot;fldigi&quot; / &quot;fldigi.exe&quot; resides
         contains a file named NBEMS.DIR then base all NBEMS file
         locations to that drive-folder
       * this allows a fully portble NBEMS installation
         to a thumbdrive (or other portable drive)
       * it also allows a very easy way to install multiple NBEMS suites
         for different target uses on a single hard drive

     UTF-8 overhaul

       * Refactor get_tx_char()
       * Reset to stock version, call byte_at()
         The class Fl_Text_Buffer_mod (borrowed from FLTK) contained a 
modified
         version of the method char_at() that effectively made it behave as
         byte_at(). Silently modifying a library-provided method not 
only disables
         the access to a certain functionality of the library, but can 
also cause
         other unforeseen consequences. The method was thus reverted to 
the stock
         version and the code that previously called the modified 
version was
         changed to call byte_at() instead.
       * Remove unneeded code in FTextTX::nextChar()
       * Libtiniconv
         - Added libtiniconv (charset conversion library)
         - Library Version 1.0.1 fetched from <A HREF="http://tiniconv.sf.net">http://tiniconv.sf.net</A>
           A small fix made to change a misspelled macro name.
           Build system adapted to fit into the fldigi build model.
       * Added CharsetDistiller class
         - Sanitize input data and convert it into UTF-8
         - CharsetDistiller receives input data one byte at a time and 
converts this
           data stream from a particular character set into UTF-8. 
Invalid input data
           is treated as if it was encoded in CP1252. Character set 
conversion is
           performed as soon as possible, i.e., when enough input is 
received to
           constitute a valid character in the input character set, this 
character is
           immediatly converted into UTF-8 and made available at the output.
       * Make put_rx_char_flmain() use charsetDistiller
       * Make put_echo_char() use CharsetDistiller
       * Make pskBrowser use CharsetDistiller
       * Added OutputEncoder class
         - Used for encoding transmitted data
         - OutputEncoder accepts UTF-8 strings at input, converts them 
to the
           selected encoding and outputs them one byte at a time.
       * TX character set conversion using OutputEncoder
       * Fix backspace for &gt;2byte UTF-8 characters
       * Global setting for RX/TX charset
       * Cleanup modem UTF-8 code
         - PSK, Olivia, MT63 and MFSK modems:
           cleanup of unneeded UTF-8 handling code
         - Everything that deals with output character set conversion 
and data
           sequencing is now done using OutputEncoder, so the modems can 
become
           completely agnostic about the character set used. As far as 
they are
           concerned, everything is just byte-sized data.
       * Added an array of character set names and identifiers
       * UTF-8 code cleanup
         - Cleanup of unneeded UTF-8 handling code in add_rxtx_char() 
and family
       * Character set selection menu
          - Add menu button to select the active TX/RX charset to the 
colors-fonts
            configure dialog.  The setting defaults to UTF-8 (selected 
at program
            startup).  The selection is saved to the program defaults 
configuration
            file when &quot;Config/Save&quot; is executed.
