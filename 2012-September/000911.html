<PRE>Hi,

Synop decoding is progressing well, I am polishing the code at the moment.

The decoding is done at three places:
* The RTTY modem now has a tick box in its config tab, which makes that 
all SYNOP tags (five-digits groups) are decoded.
* Because SYNOP messages are entities spanning several lines, with 
coordinates, this logic is a bit difficultto render accurately in the 
outptu window (Which is line and char oriented). Therefore, when a SYNOP 
message is completely validated, it is written with its coordinates and 
timestamp, in a KML file which can be viewed with Google Earth of Google 
Maps. This is not costly (It optionnaly writes data in a text file of 
the right format) but is extremely convenient to check that SYNOP 
messages are at the right place, from the right destination.
* A new &quot;flsynop&quot; program has been introduced which takes any text file 
as input and generates an output where all the SYNOP tags have been 
replaced. it uses the sale code as fldigi and is very helpful to debug 
things, but also to decode any text file.

In terms of implementation:
* Small add to rtty.cxx for diplaying the decoded result.
* New tock box in the rtty config tab.
* A couple of new text files (One of them very big but it makes things 
simpler, instead of splitting it for no reason).
* A couple of new config files for the buoys, weather statoins and ships 
definitions.

Later on, we can reuse the KML file creation, then for Navtex data 
(Which also comes with coordinates).

Any opinion or remark, please ?

Thanks

R
