<PRE>Hi Lars,

&quot;Could you claim which aspects of fidigi have had to be tweaked?&quot;

These small tweaks are necessary only because of the newer Mingw version
which comes with MXE. There is nothing critical at all because the porting
to Mingw has already been made, this is basically just another Mingw
flavour. I do not have all of them in mind but for example:

(1) printf(&quot;%lld&quot;,X); must be replaced by printf(&quot;%&quot; PRId64, X );

(2) An M4 script does not detect correctly if the platform has
sem_timedwait() because now sem_timedwait comes with libpthread.dll but
pthreadGC2.dll is obsolete (Not sure, that's the idea).

(3) Unused variables etc...

(4) Do not configure XML-RPC that I could not build yet (It will come).
Again, once you have the correct ./configure parameters, it is extremely
simple to build fldigi with MXE.


&quot;How did you include hamlib3 into mxe&quot;

I did not include it into MXE. I cross-compiled, linked and installed as a
Windows library, in the MXE environment. That is:

(1) I downloaded Hamlib3

(2) tar -xzf

(3) ./configure --the-parameters-for-mxe-in-my-previous-emails

(4) make

(5) sudo make install

&quot;Et voila&quot;, I can build any hamlib-based application for Windows, including
fldigi.


&quot;Could you explain what would be the manual step? ... If hamlib3 would not
work with our project code, I would concider to tweak the existing hamlib2&quot;
I think it is about changing the make infrastructure.

 Probably the very best is to contact Nate or Stephane.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Short recap after this conversation about how to build Hamlib3 with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MXE. Confirmation from Hamlib developers are warmly welcome :):) !!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Summary here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.hams.hamlib.devel/4012">http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.hams.hamlib.devel/4012</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note: This applies only with Hamlib3. The command I use to build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hamlib3 with MXE is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --prefix=/opt/mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/ --with-included-ltdl
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This other option does not change anything, because the static libs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are already built.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --prefix=/opt/mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/ --with-included-ltdl
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --enable-static
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is actually tested with fldigi also built with MXE (But the code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; must be tweaked).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It might be possible to build the existing version of Hamlib, but an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extra manual step is necessary which is really not worth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Many extra options are not tested yet with MXE, such as libusb, usrp,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; winradio etc... It all depends on the libraries which are already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available in MXE of course.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Remi F4ECW
