<PRE>I have received a request to incorporate a Digital Selective Calling 
decoder (no encoder) into fldigi.  The request has come from the U.S. 
Coast Guard Auxiliary, a civilian organization that provides assistance 
to the U.S. Coast Guard.  The email trail is included below.  I have 
posted the specification documents referred to at

<A HREF="http://www.w1hkj.com/DSC/">http://www.w1hkj.com/DSC/</A>

Please let me know if you are interested in working on this worthwhile 
addition to fldigi.

73, Dave, W1HKJ

Dear Dave,
I believe I found the DSC specs you requested by searching the 
International Telecommunications Union (ITU) website.
The DSC is a synchronous system using characters composed from a ten-bit 
error-detecting code. The bits are encoded using frequency shift 
keyingat 100 Baud. For High Frequency and Medium Frequency, two tones 
170 Hz apart on either side of the allocated frequency are used.  For 
VHF, the two frequencies used are 1300 and 2100 Hz. Each character is 
transmitted twice with a time delay. The detailed specification for DSC 
is published in the 56-page International Telecommunications Union 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx</A>&gt;Recommendation ITU-R M.493-12, 
which I have attached for your review.
Will this work for you and your open-source programming team?
Jason

Dear Dave,
I have obtained a copy of the ITU Recommendation ITU-R M.493-13 for you, 
which Bill spoke of in his last email. For your review and reference, I 
have also attached the ITU Operational Procedure Guide for using DSC 
radio equipment.
Bill manages and is the Net Control for our weekly West Coast Region 
Contingency Comms Net on HF.  He is also our Auxiliary Coordinator, 
supporting the U.S. Coast Guard in HF emergency contingency 
communications (both voice &amp; digital), radio systems monitoring, and the 
upcoming GMDSS/DSC monitoring program.
Thank you for your understanding, Dave, in the Auxiliary?s efforts to 
support the Coast Guard in monitoring DSC, NAVTEX, weather broadcasts, 
and emergency message-handling support.  Your FLDIGI software is not 
only a helpful tool in these efforts, but it also gives us a platform 
for teaching and motivating our Telecommunications Specialists (TCO) and 
Watchstanders to learn new technical skills and ?spread their wings? by 
practicing the most recent developments in emergency comms.
Please feel free to contact either Bill or me, should you have any 
questions.  We look forward to hearing from you soon, Dave!
Semper Paratus!
Jason

Dave and Jason,
The document that Jason sent you is the proper one for the details of 
the HF and VHF DSC protocol. Note however, that there is a later version 
(493-13) which contains some changes. That is not available to the 
public on the ITU website, but needs to be purchased.
One other caution I would add, is that I believe that there is no need 
for a transmit capability, only receive. In fact, I think that transmit 
would be somewhat risky since it could be used to &quot;spoof&quot; transmissions 
which might potentially be a security risk. Also, transmit requires the 
issuance of an MMSI number so that the source of any transmissions can 
be traced.
I've been working on a product for the recreational boater that 
accomplishes the same end and it is about 90 days from release. It will 
not be a &quot;free&quot; product, but will have a reasonable price tag.
Nice to hear that you retired as an O-5. Did you serve on the comms side?
v/r,
