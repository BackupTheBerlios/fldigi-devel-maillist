<PRE>Hello all,
Apologies for the number of mailing-lists this touches, but am taking a bit
of a survey:

Want see how many people would be interested in using, developing, and/or
testing Fldigi for &quot;high speed&quot; data over FM audio and/or FM-audio
repeaters. In my testing so far, it appears the speed would be somewhere in
the 3 Kb/s to 4 Kb/s range, possibly higher.

Since the goal is fast data, audio coupling is out: faster speeds simply
require a direct-audio connection. My inexpensive solution here was to
interface a Baofeng UV-5R to a soundcard: see attached file for details
(for good engineering practice, 1:1 isolation transformers should be added
to isolate the radio form the soundcard).
Conveniently, Baofeng and other radios contain an inbuilt VOX circuit to
control PTT. No additional interface needed (I recently purchased 3 for
this project, hihi)

I saw some testing months ago for a mode that could be used over FM
repeaters.
Here I am proposing a new digital mode: NBEMS-FM
This not a mode that I am making, but rather one I think we all should
contribute to and discuss together. This will result in a better overall
design.

The details of the NBEMS-FM mode should be, in my opinion:
 * 2 Speeds: one for Uplink / Reliability, one for Downlink / Backhaul
 * No options to accidentally mis-configure
 * Modem uses a set-frequency (no AFC to be mis-adjusted)
 * Little-to-no FEC overhead
 * Use PSK instead of QAM, to better allow for drastic audio-level
mis-adjustments to still decode
 * Common-sense balance of speed and reliability


In my testing here, it appears 8PSK is the highest constellation that is
reliable over FM audio. I have tested on-air patches for fldigi that
reliably transmitted data using two 8PSK carriers at 500 Baud, for a
datarate (raw and net) of 3Kbps. Will work on porting those patches forward
to the recent Fldigi versions.

First thing that is required is the common audio upper and lower &quot;cutoff
frequencies&quot; of amateur repeaters and radios.
&gt;<i>From the previous testing, what was the consensus?
</I>
Responses and opinions  appreciated at: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-devel">kl4yfd at gmail.com</A>, or on the mailing
