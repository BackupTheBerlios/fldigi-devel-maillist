<PRE>Hi Larry,

Glad to see other hams interested in VHF/UHF FM/SSB high-speed data modes.
:<i>-)
</I>Thank you for the reports, those real-world reports are useful information.

*About a high-speed SSB mode:*
I have already some code here that extends the fldigi RTTY modem to support
speeds of 600,1200, and 2400 baud minimum-shift-keying for use on SSB.
Since you asked ;-) I will work on porting this code forward for people to
use on both SSB and FM while the faster (and therefore more complex) mode
is being constructed. The use of SSB over FM would definitely increase the
data signal's range.

Due to the frequency inaccuracy of SSB, I found this  RTTY/MSK modem to be
far better suited. The high-speed FM mode by-design requires high frequency
accuracy and therefore will perform terribly on SSB, if at all.

My original intention with these RTTY/MSK 600, 1200, &amp; 2400 baud modes was
to use them on 10-meter and 6-meter SSB / FM. They will work even better on
2m / 70cm SSB and/or FM.

I will work on getting the &quot;high-speed SSB-or-FM RTTY/MSK modes&quot; patch
together, and push for its inclusion in the 3.21.74 release so others can
join in on the fun, hihi.

*Note*: For the SSB-or-FM-data modes: I am not adding new modes, but am
just extending the &quot;custom RTTY&quot; panel to include 3 new baudrates (600,
1200, 2400) and 3 new shifts (300,600,1200).

End goal of this is, for me personally, is to use flarq at 1200/2400 baud
on VHF/UHF.
Hopefully others will find something interesting to do with it also.
