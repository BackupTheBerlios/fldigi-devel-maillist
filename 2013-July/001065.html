-------------- next part --------------
Version 3.21.73

  Maintenance / Update release

  qrunner mod

    * changed mutex and conditional to static in req_sync

  Pskmail-test

    * continued search for pskmail program hang

  Rigcat Thread

    * Changed thread close down process.  Deprecated
        use of pthread_mutex_lock during time when main
        thread is blocking with a pthread_join on the same
        mutex variable.

  Doxygen for fldigi

  CPPcheck errors

    * fix errors found by cppcheck

  Modem class

    * Removed morse as base class of modem

  Missing header

    * Some builds reported missing header

  fldigi-shell

    * Corrected unitialized variable warning

  Fl::focus on OS X

    * Correct a Fl::focus error on OS X
        - Fl::focus returns an erroneous pointer to a
          window not owned by fldigi when the OS X
          &quot;About This Mac&quot; dialog display in front of the
          main fldigi dialog.  The ATM dialog is forced to
          front focus.  Calls like w-&gt;window() then points
          to memory outside of the application allocation.
        - correct solution is to use named_window-&gt;contains(w)
          where named_window is an existing fldigi widget and
          w is the widget returned by Fl::focus().
        - contains returns 1 if named_window or any of it's
          child windows are in that window &quot;group&quot;

        -- used for building the OS X dmg

        of buffer

  Portaudio exceptions
