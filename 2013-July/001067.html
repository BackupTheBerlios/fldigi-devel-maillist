<PRE>Here is the plot I took about a year ago.  Not exactly scientific but it
gets the point across.  I think I mis-spoke earlier.  Lower frequencies are
getting more emphasis than higher frequencies.

The blue plot is the baseline.  It was established by sending white noise
(command line switch option) from one laptop to another.  Pretty flat
response.  The spike around 4.4kHz I suspect is internal noise.

Red plot is Kenwood TM-V7A to a Kenwood TM-271A on simplex.  1200 baud port
to 1200 baud port.

Purple is same radio setup but on the TM-271A 9k6 port.

Green is V7A through a repeater and received on the 271A.  It is a current
Kenwood repeater.  We upgraded from older MFS Motorola repeaters last year.

Keep a repeater setup in mind.  Technically you have 4 radios touching all
of the audio tx radio, receiver at the repeater, transmitter at the
repeater then the receiving radio.

Talking to our repeater operator the curve from the repeater being in the
loop did not surprise him.  You can see the notch for the PL tone.

NOTE:  there was no attempt to normalize the audio levels.  Do not take the
baseline amplitude and compare it directly to the radio levels.  It is
there just to show the curve.  I do consider the radio levels normalized.
There was not adjusting of the output and it was done in the same 30 minute
period.  Audacity was used to capture a 30 second tx period, analyzed the
spit out as CSV data.  It was then plotted in Libre Office.

Being a control operator for the DCARA repeaters has is privileges.

&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies for the number of mailing-lists this touches, but am taking a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of a survey:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Want see how many people would be interested in using, developing, and/or
</I>&gt;<i> testing Fldigi for &quot;high speed&quot; data over FM audio and/or FM-audio
</I>&gt;<i> repeaters. In my testing so far, it appears the speed would be somewhere in
</I>&gt;<i> the 3 Kb/s to 4 Kb/s range, possibly higher.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the goal is fast data, audio coupling is out: faster speeds simply
</I>&gt;<i> require a direct-audio connection. My inexpensive solution here was to
</I>&gt;<i> interface a Baofeng UV-5R to a soundcard: see attached file for details
</I>&gt;<i> (for good engineering practice, 1:1 isolation transformers should be added
</I>&gt;<i> to isolate the radio form the soundcard).
</I>&gt;<i> Conveniently, Baofeng and other radios contain an inbuilt VOX circuit to
</I>&gt;<i> control PTT. No additional interface needed (I recently purchased 3 for
</I>&gt;<i> this project, hihi)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I saw some testing months ago for a mode that could be used over FM
</I>&gt;<i> repeaters.
</I>&gt;<i> Here I am proposing a new digital mode: NBEMS-FM
</I>&gt;<i> This not a mode that I am making, but rather one I think we all should
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to and discuss together. This will result in a better overall
</I>&gt;<i> design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The details of the NBEMS-FM mode should be, in my opinion:
</I>&gt;<i>  * 2 Speeds: one for Uplink / Reliability, one for Downlink / Backhaul
</I>&gt;<i>  * No options to accidentally mis-configure
</I>&gt;<i>  * Modem uses a set-frequency (no AFC to be mis-adjusted)
</I>&gt;<i>  * Little-to-no FEC overhead
</I>&gt;<i>  * Use PSK instead of QAM, to better allow for drastic audio-level
</I>&gt;<i> mis-adjustments to still decode
</I>&gt;<i>  * Common-sense balance of speed and reliability
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my testing here, it appears 8PSK is the highest constellation that is
</I>&gt;<i> reliable over FM audio. I have tested on-air patches for fldigi that
</I>&gt;<i> reliably transmitted data using two 8PSK carriers at 500 Baud, for a
</I>&gt;<i> datarate (raw and net) of 3Kbps. Will work on porting those patches forward
</I>&gt;<i> to the recent Fldigi versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First thing that is required is the common audio upper and lower &quot;cutoff
</I>&gt;<i> frequencies&quot; of amateur repeaters and radios.
</I>&gt;<i> From the previous testing, what was the consensus?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Responses and opinions  appreciated at: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-devel">kl4yfd at gmail.com</A>, or on the
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list.
