Hi Dave.

The issue is a structural one.  The present design of Hamlib is such
that the &quot;front end&quot; library is loaded when the program, such as Fldigi
or CQRlog or many more, starts.  The program will at some point
initialize Hamlib and tell Hamlib which radio to load.  At that point
the front end loads the needed &quot;back end&quot; library.  Normally this is
done using shared libraries of a &quot;plugin&quot; nature for the backends and a
given backend is loaded on demand.  This has the advantage of not
wasting uneeded memory.  This is probably not too much of an issue today
when many GB of RAM is the norm, but Hamlib was originally designed when
RAM was at more of a premium, and memory savings are still important on
older computers often used by hams and on small computers such as the
Raspberry Pi.

To do this loading we rely on a tool from the GNU project, Libtool,
which includes a dynamic loader library.  The good thing about Libtool
is that it handles the details between loading a library on Linux versus
MS Windows, for example.  As the packaging maintainer for Hamlib, I am
thankful for the ease it brings to my life.  Unfortunately, it seems to
fail only in the case where Hamlib is statically linked into Fldigi.  In
this instance the loader library is &quot;faking it&quot; (for lack of a better
term--hey, if tuners can &quot;fool&quot; a radio...) and presenting a normal
dynamic loading sequence to the program.  Somewhere in all that it falls
down and the Libtool folks don't seem too concerned about it.  Perhaps
I've yet to present them with a good demonstration.

The reason Hamlib versions later than 1.2.12 no longer work for Dave is
due to a security advisory against the version of Libtool included in
that release and older releases.  Now we rely on newer versions provided
by the Linux distribution I build the Hamlib releases on.

To get away from the current design of Hamlib would require a complete
rethink of its current architecture.  Perhaps a good way to accomplish
this is to start over with a fresh design that more mirrors the way
RigCAT works with flat text definition files for radio and other device
models so that no knowledge of programming languages or programming
would be required to contribute.  I am not the guy to do that, however,
I am a self-taught hobbyist programmer and my skill set doesn't go too
far. 

All that said, I have been building and making available a binary
release for MS Windows that includes the front end and all the back ends
as DLLs.  Perhaps there is a technical issue why these DLLs could not be
included with and linked from Fldigi.  I don't know.

I hope this helps everyone understand the issues involved.

73, de Nate &gt;&gt;
