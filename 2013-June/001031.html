Hi Dick.

Actually, I think the breakage comes from a tool we rely on from the GNU
Libtool package.  Around the time the breakage occured, we were forced
to update to a newer version of Libtool due to the version we were
including with Hamlib was the subject of a security advisory.  Had we
not made the change, Hamlib would not have been allowed to remain in
Debian and other Linux distributions.  At least that is where I have
been able to pin point the source of the issue.  

Unfortunately, I cannot tell anyone for certain that the 1.2.12 version 
of Hamlib included in Fldigi for other platforms is not a security issue
on other platforms.  As for adding new backends since 1.2.12, that has
not changed.  The programming interface for backends has remained stable
for all releases from 1.2.0 to the current 1.2.15.3.

73, de Nate &gt;&gt;
