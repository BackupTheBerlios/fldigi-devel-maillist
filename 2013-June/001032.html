<PRE>See the code in register.c, it probably boils down to a directory 
wrongly set:

  * rig_load_backend
  * Dynamically load a rig backend through dlopen mechanism

Printf the directory where hamlib tries to load the dlls from: It is 
probably not the right one. No need to break the whole stuff just for this.

	/*
	 * lt_dlinit may be called several times
	 *
	 * FIXME: make static build seamless
	 */

	/*
	 * external module not found? try dlopenself for backends
	 * compiled in static
	 */

If you want to get rid of dynamic loading but still keep most of the 
code, I suggest two solutions:
* you just need to build at compile time a list of all rigs
* Or you replace the macro MAKE_VERSIONED_FN, so that it will 
self-register its function at startup when not in a DLL (GCC functions 
called before main() with 'constructor' attribute). After the 
application startup, all these functions will have registered their 
adresses and dlopen will not be necessary. Example:


#define DECLARE_INITRIG_BACKEND(backend) \
void startup ## ABI_VERSION ## _ ## backend(void) __attribute__ 
((constructor))
{
  GlobalRegister( initrigs ## ABI_VERSION ## _ ## backend, #backend );\
}\
EXTERN_C BACKEND_EXPORT(int) MAKE_VERSIONED_FN(initrigs, ABI_VERSION, 
backend(void *be_handle))

The function GlobalRegister will simply do before main() is called, what 
the function rig_load_backed() does when scanning the shared libraries.


Doing this, you do not need to change the backends.

This kind of technique called &quot;Factory pattern&quot; is massively used. Read 
this before breaking nice code which works in 99% of cases. Yes it is 
complicated but once this is done it does not need to be changed:

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Dave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue is a structural one.  The present design of Hamlib is such
</I>&gt;<i> that the &quot;front end&quot; library is loaded when the program, such as Fldigi
</I>&gt;<i> or CQRlog or many more, starts.  The program will at some point
</I>&gt;<i> initialize Hamlib and tell Hamlib which radio to load.  At that point
</I>&gt;<i> the front end loads the needed &quot;back end&quot; library.  Normally this is
</I>&gt;<i> done using shared libraries of a &quot;plugin&quot; nature for the backends and a
</I>&gt;<i> given backend is loaded on demand.  This has the advantage of not
</I>&gt;<i> wasting uneeded memory.  This is probably not too much of an issue today
</I>&gt;<i> when many GB of RAM is the norm, but Hamlib was originally designed when
</I>&gt;<i> RAM was at more of a premium, and memory savings are still important on
</I>&gt;<i> older computers often used by hams and on small computers such as the
</I>&gt;<i> Raspberry Pi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To do this loading we rely on a tool from the GNU project, Libtool,
</I>&gt;<i> which includes a dynamic loader library.  The good thing about Libtool
</I>&gt;<i> is that it handles the details between loading a library on Linux versus
</I>&gt;<i> MS Windows, for example.  As the packaging maintainer for Hamlib, I am
</I>&gt;<i> thankful for the ease it brings to my life.  Unfortunately, it seems to
</I>&gt;<i> fail only in the case where Hamlib is statically linked into Fldigi.  In
</I>&gt;<i> this instance the loader library is &quot;faking it&quot; (for lack of a better
</I>&gt;<i> term--hey, if tuners can &quot;fool&quot; a radio...) and presenting a normal
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic loading sequence to the program.  Somewhere in all that it falls
</I>&gt;<i> down and the Libtool folks don't seem too concerned about it.  Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> I've yet to present them with a good demonstration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason Hamlib versions later than 1.2.12 no longer work for Dave is
</I>&gt;<i> due to a security advisory against the version of Libtool included in
</I>&gt;<i> that release and older releases.  Now we rely on newer versions provided
</I>&gt;<i> by the Linux distribution I build the Hamlib releases on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To get away from the current design of Hamlib would require a complete
</I>&gt;<i> rethink of its current architecture.  Perhaps a good way to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> this is to start over with a fresh design that more mirrors the way
</I>&gt;<i> RigCAT works with flat text definition files for radio and other device
</I>&gt;<i> models so that no knowledge of programming languages or programming
</I>&gt;<i> would be required to contribute.  I am not the guy to do that, however,
</I>&gt;<i> I am a self-taught hobbyist programmer and my skill set doesn't go too
</I>&gt;<i> far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All that said, I have been building and making available a binary
</I>&gt;<i> release for MS Windows that includes the front end and all the back ends
</I>&gt;<i> as DLLs.  Perhaps there is a technical issue why these DLLs could not be
</I>&gt;<i> included with and linked from Fldigi.  I don't know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this helps everyone understand the issues involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 73, de Nate&gt;&gt;
