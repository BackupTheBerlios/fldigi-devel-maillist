<PRE>I have been privately asked, off the mailing-list (Not sure this is good 
for an open-source project, on a critical problem, but that is another 
question):

&gt;<i> Are you willing to try modifying hamlib-1.2.15.3 to provide this
</I>&gt;<i> function registration capability?
</I>
No, because: My job would be this fix and only this one, without the 
possibility to add other changes which I think could be useful, funny, 
interesting etc... Frustration, debugging and work, without the money, 
the freedom and the creativity.

And the other changes I would like to bring will not even be discussed. 
Would the attitude of Stelios (Fldigi) and Stephane (Hamlib) would the 
same ? I think not. I remember they were very easy to accept changes 
made by other people. This time is gone apparently.

PS: FYI, a technically similar solution is in a change I recently did in 
Hamlib (Based on static objects constructors but this is similar to gcc 
constructor/destructor attributes) , but this change will never be 
promoted to the main branch I guess.
