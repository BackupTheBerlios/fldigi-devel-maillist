<PRE>Greg,

Agreed with you Greg. The problem that I try to solve here has to do
with cross-compilation.

I wish to build fldigi on several platforms and for this I tried MXE
<A HREF="http://mxe.cc">http://mxe.cc</A> which comes with many libraries.

It worked without any problem for hamlib 3.0 ( Which is API compatible
with the other versions ). But MXE cannot build xmlrpc-c apparently
(But maybe I did things wrong ).

As I remember that Stelios wanted to get rid of this library
dependency, we would get easier cross-compiling at the same time.

Until things progress on this side, I will try to build fldigi with
MXE, but without XML-RPC support.
