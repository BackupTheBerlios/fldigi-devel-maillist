&gt;<i> Agreed with you Greg. The problem that I try to solve here has to do

</I>
&gt;<i> I wish to build fldigi on several platforms and for this I tried MXE
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mxe.cc">http://mxe.cc</A> which comes with many libraries.
</I>
I see.  What platforms are you building for?  I'm curious if these are
systems that run something POSIXy, something Windows-y, or an
unhosted/small environment like an arduino (but presumably without a
display, at least parts of it would be left out).

For background, I work on pkgsrc and NetBSD.  NetBSD's system builds are
always cross (so you can build the entire OS for a Raspberry Pi on
desktop, such as a mac).  pkgsrc doesn't really support cross yet, but
it's not so far away and someone is working on it.  It supports many
systems, even cygwin now.  At work we have made various other programs
build cross, using the NetBSD compiler toolchain, building on amd64 and
compiling for an embedded processor ship (not a Pi, but not so different
for this discussion).

&gt;<i> It worked without any problem for hamlib 3.0 ( Which is API compatible
</I>&gt;<i> with the other versions ). But MXE cannot build xmlrpc-c apparently
</I>&gt;<i> (But maybe I did things wrong ).
</I>
It seems there's been a trend away from autoconf as people claim it's
too complicated and messy, but it does do a good job of supporting
cross.

It seems xmprpc-c uses automake, so I'd expect it to be not so hard to
get it to cross build.  Perhaps you can post (or send to me privately,
if others find this not interesting) the build script and what failed.

&gt;<i> As I remember that Stelios wanted to get rid of this library
</I>&gt;<i> dependency, we would get easier cross-compiling at the same time.
</I>
Sure, if it's really &quot;gotten rid of&quot;.  My point was that folding it in
trades one set of problems for another.

&gt;<i> Until things progress on this side, I will try to build fldigi with
</I>&gt;<i> MXE, but without XML-RPC support.
</I>
Presumably that just drops qrz lookups?
