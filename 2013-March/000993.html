<PRE>Hi Greg,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed with you Greg. The problem that I try to solve here has to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with cross-compilation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wish to build fldigi on several platforms and for this I tried MXE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mxe.cc">http://mxe.cc</A> which comes with many libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see.  What platforms are you building for?  I'm curious if these are
</I>&gt;<i> systems that run something POSIXy, something Windows-y, or an
</I>&gt;<i> unhosted/small environment like an arduino (but presumably without a
</I>&gt;<i> display, at least parts of it would be left out).
</I>
Windows.

&gt;<i> For background, I work on pkgsrc and NetBSD.  NetBSD's system builds are
</I>&gt;<i> always cross (so you can build the entire OS for a Raspberry Pi on
</I>&gt;<i> desktop, such as a mac).  pkgsrc doesn't really support cross yet, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's not so far away and someone is working on it.  It supports many
</I>&gt;<i> systems, even cygwin now.  At work we have made various other programs
</I>&gt;<i> build cross, using the NetBSD compiler toolchain, building on amd64 and
</I>&gt;<i> compiling for an embedded processor ship (not a Pi, but not so different
</I>&gt;<i> for this discussion).
</I>
Ah ah, sounds great. I will have a serious look.

&gt;&gt;<i> It worked without any problem for hamlib 3.0 ( Which is API compatible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the other versions ). But MXE cannot build xmlrpc-c apparently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (But maybe I did things wrong ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems there's been a trend away from autoconf as people claim it's
</I>&gt;<i> too complicated and messy, but it does do a good job of supporting
</I>&gt;<i> cross.
</I>
I would tend to say it is not obvious to understand what it does and
what it is made for. What makes things more complicated is that
releases are not stable and packagers force people to use the latest
autotools/autoconf/autoreconf/automake version. Error messages are not
very clear too. On top of that, there are not many people to
understand how it works.

&gt;<i> It seems xmprpc-c uses automake, so I'd expect it to be not so hard to
</I>&gt;<i> get it to cross build.  Perhaps you can post (or send to me privately,
</I>&gt;<i> if others find this not interesting) the build script and what failed.
</I>
Very simple (It's a development mailing list about fldigi isn't it):
(1) Install mxe. It is funny to see it downloading and compiling code.
Takes hours but it is easy to fix things nearly on-the-fly.
(2) Download and untar xmlrpc-c
(3) ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32 PlusOtherIgnoredOptions

I try to see which options should be used.

&gt;&gt;<i> As I remember that Stelios wanted to get rid of this library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependency, we would get easier cross-compiling at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, if it's really &quot;gotten rid of&quot;.  My point was that folding it in
</I>&gt;<i> trades one set of problems for another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Until things progress on this side, I will try to build fldigi with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MXE, but without XML-RPC support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Presumably that just drops qrz lookups?
</I>
Not sure of this is the case but it would be sad !

My goal is just to temporarily test new features with development
versions, not to deliver a new public version.

For example I wish to test that a new piece of code I wrote will more
or less work on a PC, enough so that it can be shown and we can
discuss about it.

Thanks.
</PRE>
