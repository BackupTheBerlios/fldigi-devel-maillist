Hello, David.

I  like  your Fldigi a lot. Previously i was using the DM780, but yous
software has some advantages that are important for me.

Do you have any plans for further improvements?

As you know, SDRs become more and more popular. And here are 2 points.

Firts, with SDR we have no such hard limit in RX bandwidth and it will
be  very  useful to have a software, which can decode signals in wider
bandwidth  (for  example  20 kHz for 44100 sampling rate or even wider
with IQ stream).
Is   it   possible  to  decode all the signals in RX bandwidth? I mean
that  it  would  be just great to see not only psk31, but also 63, 125
and even rtty if they are in this band...

The  second  point  is the following... With SDR we do not have a real
audio  or  COM  port.  What  do you think about interfacing with SDRs?
Maybe  some  network  interface or any DLL? All these VACs and virtual
COM ports are sources of different problems as you know...

What do you think about it?

Best regards, Alexandr Gromov.
